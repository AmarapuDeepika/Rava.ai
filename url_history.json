Two players from thebattingteam, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holdingbats, while one player from thefieldingteam, the bowler,bowlstheballtoward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring onerunfor each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches theboundaryof the field or when the ball is bowledillegally.\nThe fielding team tries to prevent runs from being scored bydismissingbatters (so they are \"out\"). Means of dismissal include beingbowled, when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side eithercatchingthe ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ballbeforea batter can cross thecrease linein front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, theinnings(playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles.Forms of cricketrange from traditionalTest matchesplayed over five days to the newerTwenty20format (also known asT20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20overs(each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four hours.\nTraditionally, cricketers play in all-whitekit, but inlimited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressedleatherwith a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing acorkcore layered with tightly wound string.\nThe earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played inSouth East Englandin the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of theBritish Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is theInternational Cricket Council(ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which arefull memberswho play Test matches. The game's rules, theLaws of Cricket, are maintained byMarylebone Cricket Club(MCC) inLondon. The sport is followed primarily inSouth Asia,Australia,New Zealand, theUnited Kingdom,Southern Africa, and theWest Indies.[2]\nWomen's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard.\nThe most successful side playinginternational cricketisAustralia, which has won eightOne Day Internationaltrophies, including sixWorld Cups, more than any other country, and has been thetop-rated Test sidemore than any other country.[3][4]\nCricket is one of many games in the \"club ball\" sphere that involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement. Others includebaseball(which shares manysimilaritieswith cricket, both belonging in the more specificbat-and-ball gamescategory[5]),golf,hockey,tennis,squash,badmintonandtable tennis.[6]In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a \"wicket gate\" through which sheep were herded), that the batter must defend.[7]The cricket historianHarry Althamidentified three \"groups\" of \"club ball\" games: the \"hockey group\", in which the ball is driven to and from between two targets (the goals); the \"golf group\", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the \"cricket group\", in which \"the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it\".[8]\nIt is generally believed that cricket originated as achildren's gamein the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during themedieval period.[7]Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case inGuildfordin January 1597 (Old Style, equating to January 1598 in the modern calendar). The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land, and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-oldcoroner,John Derrick, who gave witness that:[9][10][11]\nBeing a scholler in theffree schoole of Guldefordhee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies.\nGiven Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school, and so it is certain that cricket was being playedc.1550by boys inSurrey.[11]The view that it was originally a children's game is reinforced byRandle Cotgrave's 1611 English-Frenchdictionary in which he defined the noun \"crosse\"as \"the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket\", and the verb form \"crosser\"as \"to play at cricket\".[12][13]\nOne possible source for the sport's name is theOld Englishword \"cryce\"(or \"cricc\") meaning a crutch or staff. InSamuel Johnson'sDictionary, he derived cricket from \"cryce, Saxon, a stick\".[9]InOld French, the word \"criquet\"seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.[14]Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and theCounty of Flanderswhen the latter belonged to theDuchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from theMiddle Dutch(in use in Flanders at the time) \"krick\"(-e), meaning a stick (crook).[14]Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word \"krickstoel\", meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church that resembled the long lowwicketwith twostumpsused in early cricket.[15]According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert ofBonn University, \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, \"met de (krik ket)sen\" (\"with the stick chase\").[16]Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.[16]\nAlthough the main object of the game has always been to score the mostruns, the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects; the North American variant of cricket known aswicketretained many of these aspects.[17]Theballwasbowled underarmby thebowlerand along the ground towards abatterarmed with abatthat in shape resembled ahockey stick; the batter defended a low, two-stumpwicket; and runs were called notches because thescorersrecorded them by notching tally sticks.[18][19][20]\nIn 1611, the yearCotgrave's dictionary was published,ecclesiastical courtrecords atSidleshaminSussexstate that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter, failed to attend church onEaster Sundaybecause they were playing cricket. They were fined 12deach and ordered to dopenance.[21]This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised inter-parish orvillagematch was played, atChevening, Kent.[9][22]In 1624, a player calledJasper Vinalldied after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.[23]\nCricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the 17th century.[13]It is known, through numerous references found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been proscribed at times by thePuritansbefore and during theCommonwealth.[24][25]The problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play, as the Puritans considered cricket to be \"profane\" if played on theSabbath, especially if large crowds orgamblingwere involved.[26][27]\nAccording to the social historianDerek Birley, there was a \"great upsurge of sport after theRestoration\" in 1660.[28]Several members of the court of KingCharles IItook a strong interest in cricket during that era.[29]Gambling on sport became a problem significant enough forParliamentto pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes to\u00a3100, which was, in any case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the population.[28]Along withhorse racing, as well asprizefightingand other types ofblood sport, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport.[30]Rich patrons made matches for high stakes, forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players.[31]By the end of the century, cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers\u2014the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated 1676.[32]A 1697 newspaper report survives of \"a great cricket match\" played in Sussex \"for fifty guineas apiece\", the earliest known contest that is generally considered aFirst Classmatch.[33][34]\nThe patrons and other players from thegentrybegan to classify themselves as \"amateurs\"[fn 1]to establish a clear distinction from the professionals, who were invariably members of theworking class, even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities.[35]The gentry, including such high-ranking nobles as theDukes of Richmond, exerted their honour code ofnoblesse obligeto claim rights of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in, especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their \"social inferiors\" if they were to win their bets.[36]In time, a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in first-class cricket, until 1962 when amateurism was abolished, was someone with apublic schooleducation who had then gone to one ofCambridgeorOxford University. Society insisted that such people were \"officers and gentlemen\" whose destiny was to provide leadership.[37]In a purely financial sense, the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee; in practice, many amateurs claimed more than actual expenditure, and the derisive term \"shamateur\" was coined to describe the practice.[38][39]\nThe game underwent major development in the 18th century to become England'snational sport.[40]Its success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting.[41]Cricket was prominent inLondonas early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on theArtillery GroundinFinsbury.[citation needed]Thesingle wicketform of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the1748 season.[42]Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began topitch (bounce) the ballinstead of rolling or skimming it towards the batter. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old \"hockey stick\" shape.[43][citation needed]\nTheHambledon Clubwas founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation ofMarylebone Cricket Club(MCC) and the opening ofLord's Old Groundin 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point.[citation needed]MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of theLaws of Cricket. New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century include the three-stump wicket andleg before wicket(lbw).[44]\nThe 19th century sawunderarm bowlingsuperseded by firstroundarmand thenoverarm bowling. Both developments were controversial.[45]Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of thecounty clubs, starting withSussexin 1839.[46]In December 1889, the eight leading county clubs formed the officialCounty Championship, which began in 1890.[47]\nThe most famous player of the 19th century wasW. G. Grace, who started his long and influential career in 1865. It was especially during the career of Grace that the distinction between amateurs and professionals became blurred by the existence of players like him who were nominally amateur but, in terms of their financial gain,de factoprofessional. Grace himself was said to have been paid more money for playing cricket than any professional.[citation needed]\nThe last two decades before theFirst World Warhave been called the \"Golden Age of cricket\". It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county andTest leveldeveloped.[48]\nIn 1844, thefirst-ever international matchtook place between what were essentially club teams, from theUnited StatesandCanada, inToronto; Canada won.[49][50]In 1859, a team of English players went to North America onthe first overseas tour.[51]Meanwhile, theBritish Empirehad been instrumental in spreading the game overseas, and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established inAustralia, theCaribbean,British India(which includes present-dayPakistanandBangladesh),New Zealand,North AmericaandSouth Africa.[52]\nIn 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia.[53]The first Australian team to travel overseas consisted ofAboriginalstockmenwhotoured England in 1868.[54]\nIn 1876\u201377, anEngland teamtook part in what was retrospectively recognised as the first-everTest matchat theMelbourne Cricket GroundagainstAustralia.[55]The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth toThe Ashesin 1882, which remains Test cricket's most famous contest.[56]Test cricket began to expand in 1888\u201389 whenSouth Africaplayed England.[57]\nThe inter-war years were dominated byAustralia'sDon Bradman, statistically the greatest Test batter of all time. To curb his dominance, England employedbodylinetactics during the1932\u201333 Ashes series. These involved bowling at the body of the batter and setting a field, resulting in batters having to choose between being hit or risk getting out. This series moved cricket from a game to a matter ofnational importance, with diplomatic cables being passed between the two countries over the incident.[58]\nDuring this time, the number of Test nations continued to grow, with theWest Indies,New ZealandandIndiabeing admitted as full Test members within a four-year period from 1928 to 1932.\nAn enforced break during theSecond World Warstopped Test Cricket for a time, although thePartition of IndiacausedPakistanto gain Test status in 1952. As teams began to travel more, the game quickly grew from 500 tests in 84 years to 1000 within the next 23.\nCricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced thelimited oversvariant.[59]As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative, and the number of matches increased.[60]The firstLimited Overs Internationalwas played in 1971, and the governingInternational Cricket Council(ICC), seeing its potential, staged the first limited oversCricket World Cupin1975.[61]\nSri Lankajoined the ranks in 1982. Meanwhile, South Africa was banned by the ICC due toapartheidfrom 1970 until 1992. 1992 also brought about the introduction of theZimbabwe team.[62]\nThe 21st century brought with it theBangladesh Team, who made their Test debut in 2000. The game itself also grew, with a new format made up of 20-over innings being created. This format, calledT20 cricket, quickly became a highly popular format, putting the longer formats at risk. The new shorter format also introducedfranchisecricket, with new tournaments like the Indian Premier League and the AustralianBig Bash League. The ICC has selected the T20 format as cricket's growth format, and has introduced aT20 World Cupwhich is played every two years;[64]T20 cricket has also been increasingly accepted into major events such as theAsian Games.[65]The resultant growth has seen cricket's fanbase cross one billion people, with90% of themin South Asia.[2]T20's success has also spawned evenshorter formats, such as10-over cricket(T10) and100-ball cricket, though not without controversy.[66]\nOutside factors have also taken their toll on cricket. For example, the2008 Mumbai attacksled India and Pakistan to suspend theirbilateral seriesindefinitely. The2009 attack on the Sri Lankan teamduring their tour of Pakistan led to Pakistan being unable to host matches until 2019.[67][68][69][70]\nIn 2017,AfghanistanandIrelandbecame the 11th and 12th Test nations.[71][72]\nIn cricket, the rules of the game are codified inThe Laws of Cricket(hereinafter called \"the Laws\"), which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital \"L\"). The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744, and since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, theMarylebone Cricket Club(MCC) inLondon.[73]\nCricket is abat-and-ball gameplayed on acricket field(see image of cricket pitch and creases) between two teams of eleven players each.[74]The field is usually circular or oval in shape, and the edge of the playing area is marked by aboundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line, or a combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.[75]\nIn the approximate centre of the field is a rectangularpitch(see image, below) on which a wooden target called awicketis sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20\u00a0m) apart.[76]The pitch is a flat surface 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of three woodenstumpstopped by twobails.[77]\nAs illustrated, the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines: abowling crease, apopping creaseand tworeturn creases. The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease, which is eight feet eight inches long. The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it; although it is drawn as a 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) line (six feet on either side of the wicket), it is, in fact, unlimited in length. The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) line, so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease, but is also, in fact, unlimited in length.[78]\nBefore a match begins, the teamcaptains(who are also players)toss a cointo decide which team willbatfirst and so take the firstinnings.[79]\"Innings\" is the term used for each phase of play in the match.[79]In each innings, one team bats, attempting toscoreruns, while the other teambowlsandfieldstheball, attempting to restrict the scoring anddismissthe batters.[80][81]When the first innings ends, the teams change roles; there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match. A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days; a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day.[79]During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time.[a]The order of batters is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.[74]\nThe main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents, but in some forms of cricket, it is also necessary to dismiss all but one of the opposition batters (making their team 'all out') in their final innings in order to win the match, which would otherwise bedrawn(not ending with a winner or tie.)[84]\nThewicket-keeper(a specialised fielder behind the batter) and the batters wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than 145 kilometres per hour (90\u00a0mph) and presents a major health and safety concern. Protective clothing includespads(designed to protect the knees and shins),batting glovesorwicket-keeper's glovesfor the hands, asafety helmetfor the head, and aboxfor male players inside the trousers (to protect thecrotcharea).[85]Some batters wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batter (i.e., if they are alongside or in front of him), but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards.[86]\nSubject to certain variations, on-field clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves; long trousers; woolen pullover (if needed);cricket cap(for fielding) or a safety helmet; and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction. Thekitis traditionally all white, and this remains the case in Test and first-class cricket, but in limited overs cricket, team colours are now worn instead.[87]\ni) A used white ball. White balls are mainly used inlimited overs cricket, especially in matches played at night, underfloodlights(left).\nThe essence of the sport is that abowlerdelivers(i.e., bowls) theballfrom their end of thepitchtowards thebatterwho, armed with abat, is \"on strike\" at the other end (see next sub-section:Basic gameplay).\nThebatis made of wood, usuallySalix alba(white willow), and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. The blade must not be more than 4.25 inches (10.8\u00a0cm) wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches (97\u00a0cm). There is no standard for the weight, which is usually between 2\u00a0lb 7\u00a0oz and 3\u00a0lb (1.1 and 1.4\u00a0kg).[88][89]\nTheballis a hard leather-seamedspheroid, with a circumference of 9 inches (23\u00a0cm). The ball has a \"seam\": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable; during the course of this deterioration, its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. Players will, therefore, attempt to modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva was legal, even when the polishing was deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball'sswing through the air. The use of saliva has since been made illegal due to theCOVID-19 pandemic.[90]The acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seams constitute illegalball tampering.[91]\nDuring normal play, thirteen players and twoumpiresare on the field. Two of the players arebattersand the rest are all eleven members of thefieldingteam. The other nine players in the batting team are off the field in thepavilion. The image with overlay below shows what is happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to thepitch.[92]\nIn the photo, the two batters (3 and 8, wearing yellow) have taken position at each end of the pitch (6). Three members of the fielding team (4, 10 and 11, wearing dark blue) are in shot. One of the two umpires (1, wearing white hat) is stationed behind thewicket(2) at thebowler's(4) end of the pitch. The bowler (4) isbowlingtheball(5) from his end of the pitch to the batter (8) at the other end who is called the \"striker\". The other batter (3) at the bowling end is called the \"non-striker\". Thewicket-keeper(10), who is a specialist, is positioned behind the striker's wicket (9), and behind him stands one of the fielders in a position called \"first slip\" (11). While the bowler and the first slip are wearing conventional kit only, the two batters and the wicket-keeper are wearing protective gear, including safety helmets, padded gloves and leg guards (pads).\nWhile the umpire (1) in shot stands at the bowler's end of the pitch, his colleague stands in the outfield, usually in or near the fielding position called \"square leg\", so that he is in line with thepopping crease(7) at the striker's end of the pitch. The bowling crease (not numbered) is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases (12). The bowler (4) intends to hit the wicket (9) with the ball (5) or at least prevent the striker (8) from scoringruns. The striker (8) intends, by using his bat, to defend his wicket and, if possible, hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs.\nSome players are skilled in both batting and bowling, or either of these as well as wicket-keeping, so are termedall-rounders. Bowlers are classified according to their style, generally asfast bowlers,seam bowlersorspinners. Batters are classified according to whether they are right-handed or left-handed.\nThe Laws state that, throughout an innings, \"the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls\".[93]The name \"over\" came about because the umpire calls \"Over!\" when six legal balls (deliveries) have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batters do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a \"spell\"; if the captain wants a bowler to \"change ends\", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate. The batters do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at \"square leg\" now stands behind the wicket at the nonstriker's end and vice versa.[93]\nOf the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above. The other eight are elsewhere on the field, their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler. Fielders often change position between deliveries, again as directed by the captain or bowler.[86]\nIf a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, asubstituteis allowed to field instead of the aforementioned fielder, but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain, except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.[83]The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return.[94]TheLaws of Cricketwere updated in 2017 to allow substitutes to act as wicket-keepers.[95]\nBatters take turns to bat via abatting orderwhich is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires, though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team.[74]Substitute batters are generally not allowed,[94]except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.[83]\nIn order to begin batting the batter first adopts a batting stance. Standardly, this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket, looking in the direction of the bowler, and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot.[96]\nA skilled batter can use a wide array of \"shots\" or \"strokes\" in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat, it is called an \"edge\". The batter does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to thewicket-keeper. Equally, the batter does not have to attempt a run when hitting the ball with their bat. Batters do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs by simply making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists, or by simply \"blocking\" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that the player has time to take a run. A wide variety of shots are played, the batter's repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., \"cut\", \"drive\", \"hook\", and \"pull\".[97]\nThe batter on strike (i.e., the \"striker\") must prevent the ball from hitting the wicket and try to scorerunsby hitting the ball with their bat so that the batter and their partner have time to switch places, with each of them running from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball and attempt arun out(throwing the ball at one of the wickets before the run is scored.) To register a run, both runners must touch thegroundbehind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batters carry their bats as they run) before a fielder can throw the ball at the nearby wicket. Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.[98]\nThe decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batter who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling, usually \"yes\", \"no\" or \"wait\". More than one run can be scored from a single hit. Hits worth one to three runs are common, but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more.[98]To compensate for this, hits thatreach the boundaryof the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the grounden routeto the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. In these cases the batters do not need to run.[99]Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of \"overthrows\" by a fielder returning the ball.\nIf an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batters have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.[98]\nAdditional runs can be gained by the batting team asextras(called \"sundries\" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways:no-ball, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if they break the rules (often by failing to bowl the ball before their front foot passes the popping crease at their end);[100]wide, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if they bowl so that the ball is out of the batter's reach;[101]bye, an extra awarded if the batter misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batters time to run in the conventional way;[102]andleg bye, as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batter's body, though not their bat.[102]If the bowler has bowled an illegal delivery (i.e., a no-ball or a wide), the bowler's team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again, and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball. In addition, the ways in which the batters can be dismissed on an illegal delivery greatly narrow down; in the case of a no-ball, which is the more egregious type of illegal delivery, the only common way in which the batters can be dismissed is by being run out.[100][101]\nThere are nine ways in which a batter can be dismissed: five relatively common and four extremely rare. When a batter is dismissed, they are said to have 'lost their wicket', and are barred from batting again in that innings; their team is also said to have 'lost a wicket'. Once a team has lost 10 wickets, its innings is over. The common forms of dismissal arebowled(when the striker fails to prevent a delivery from hitting their wicket),[103]caught(when a ball struck by the bat is caught by a fielder before it hits the ground),[104]leg before wicket(lbw - when the striker's body 'unfairly' prevents a delivery from hitting the wicket),[105]run out(generally when the ball is thrown at a wicket by a fielder while the batters are running between the wickets),[106]andstumped(a special type of run out - involves the wicket keeper hitting the wicket with the ball).[107]Rare methods arehit wicket(a striker hitting their own wicket),[108]hit the ball twice,[109]obstructing the field,[110]andtimed out(a batter failing to enter the field in a timely manner).[111]The Laws state that the fielding team, usually the bowler in practice, must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give their decision. If the batter is out, the umpire raises a forefinger and says \"Out!\"; otherwise, the umpire will shake their head and say \"Not out\".[112]There is, effectively, a tenth method of dismissal,retired out(self-dismissal - generally permanent except in cases of injury), which is not an on-field dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.[113]\nDeliveries:\nDeliveries:\nMost bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler, although some are all-rounders, and even specialist batters bowl occasionally. These specialists bowl \"spells\" that are generally 4 to 8 overs long in order not to physically exhaust the bowler, cause muscle strain and stress the skeleton. The rules prevent a single bowler from bowling consecutive overs, resulting in at least two bowlers alternating each over. If the captain wants a bowler to \"change ends\", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate.[93]The action of bowling the ball is akin to throwing, with the caveat that a bowler's elbow extension is almost entirely restricted, resulting in most bowlers maintaining a straight arm when releasing the ball during their delivery stride. Additionally, while the bowler is not required to pitch (bounce) the ball, a full toss (non-bouncing) delivery that reaches the striker above waist height is penalised as ano-ball.\nA bowler reaches their delivery stride by means of a \"run-up\", and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts their run-up for the first delivery of that over, the ball then being \"in play\".[93]Fast bowlers, or pacemen, need momentum, taking a lengthy run up, while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling. The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour (90\u00a0mph), and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batter, who is forced to react very quickly.[114]Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ballseamorswing(i.e., curve) in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batter into miscuing their shot, for example, so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be \"caught behind\" by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder.[114]At the other end of the bowling scale is thespin bowler, who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batter. A spinner will often \"buy their wicket\" by \"tossing one up\" (in a slower, steeperparabolicpath) to lure the batter into making a poor shot. The batter has to be very wary of such deliveries, as the batter is often \"flighted\" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as the batter expects it to, and the batter could be \"trapped\" into getting themself out. Accidental full toss deliveries can also get wickets, as the failure of the ball to bounce can surprise a batsman or induce a poor stroke in an effort to punish the poor delivery with a boundary hit.[115]In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium-paced seamers, who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batter's concentration.[114]\nThe captain is often the most experienced player in the team, certainly the most tactically astute, and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batter, a bowler or a wicket-keeper. Within the Laws, the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating their players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that the captain's players conduct themselves \"within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the Laws\".[74]\nThe wicket-keeper (sometimes called simply the \"keeper\") is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the Laws about their equipment and demeanour. The wicket-keeper is the only member of the fielding side who can effect astumpingand is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards.[116]\nDepending on their primary skills, the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batters or specialist bowlers. Generally, a team will include five or six specialist batters, and four or five specialist bowlers, plus the wicket-keeper.[117][118]\nThere are a number of ways that a cricket match can end and its result be described, depending on whether the team batting first or last wins as well as the format of the game.\nIf the team batting last is 'all out' having scored fewer runs than their opponents, they are said to have \"lost bynruns\" (wherenis the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have \"won bynwickets\", wherenis the number of wickets left to fall (batters yet to be dismissed) until the team would have been all out. For example, a team that passes its opponents' total having lost six wickets (i.e., six of their batters have been dismissed) wins the match \"by four wickets\", since the team would only have been prevented from scoring the winning runs if four more of its batters had been dismissed, which would have resulted in all but one of its eleven batters being dismissed.[84]\nIn a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total. The team with the greater score is then said to have \"won by an innings andnruns\" and does not need to bat again:nis the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores. If the team batting last is all out and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is atie; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only 62 happening infirst-class matchesfrom the earliest known instance in 1741 until January 2017. In thetraditional formof the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared adraw.[84]\nIf the match has only a single innings per side, then usually a maximum number of overs applies to each innings. Such a match is called a \"limited overs\" or \"one-day\" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur. In some cases, ties are broken by having each team bat for a one-over innings known as aSuper Over; subsequent Super Overs may be played if the first Super Over ends in a tie. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as theDuckworth\u2013Lewis\u2013Stern methodafter its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a \"no-result\" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible, for example, wet weather.[84]\nIn all forms of cricket, the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to continue.[119]There have been instances of entire matches, evenTest matchesscheduled to be played over five days, being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled, for example, the third Test of the 1970/71 series in Australia.[120]\nThe innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play during a match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so. The innings terminates if the batting team is \"all out\", a term defined by the Laws: \"At thefall of a wicketor the retirement of a batter, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batter is available to come in\".[79]In this situation, one of the batters has not been dismissed and is termednot out; this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batters while the innings is in progress.\nAn innings may end early while there are still two not out batters:[79]\nThe game on the field is regulated by the twoumpires, one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end and the other in a position called \"square leg\", which is about 15\u201320\u00a0m (49\u201366\u00a0ft) away from the batter on strike and in line with the popping crease on which that umpire is taking guard. The umpires have several responsibilities, including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled (i.e., not ano-ballor awide); when a run is scored; whether a batter is out (the fielding side must firstappealto the umpire, usually with the phrase \"How's that?\" or \"Howzat?\"); when intervals start and end; and the suitability of the pitch, field and weather for playing the game. The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.[119]\nOff the field in televised matches, there is usually athird umpirewho can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions forTestandLimited Overs Internationalmatches played between two ICC full member countries. These matches also have amatch refereewhose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the game.[119]\nThe match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two officialscorers, one representing each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire (see image, right). For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batter is out (has been dismissed); the umpire raises both arms above their head if the batter has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored, wickets taken, and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game.[121]\nA match'sstatisticsare summarised on ascorecard. Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches ontally sticks, and runs were originally called notches.[122]According to historianRowland Bowen, the earliest known scorecard templates were introduced in 1776 by T. Pratt ofSevenoaksand soon came into general use.[123]It is believed that scorecards were printed and sold atLord'sfor the first time in 1846.[124]\nScores are displayed differently depending on location, although it is standard to show how many wickets have been lost and how many runs a team has made. Within Australia, the format is Wickets/Runs, while in the rest of the world, the format is Runs/Wickets. For example, a score of 125 runs with 4 wickets lost would be displayed as 4/125 or 125/4, respectively.[125]\nBesides observing the Laws, cricketers must respect the \"Spirit of Cricket\", a concept encompassingsportsmanship, fair play and mutual respect. This spirit has long been considered an integral part of the sport but is only nebulously defined. Amidst concern that the spirit was weakening, in 2000, a Preamble was added to the Laws instructing all participants to play within the spirit of the game. The Preamble was last updated in 2017, now opening with the line:[126]\nCricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the Laws, but also within the Spirit of Cricket.\nThe Preamble is a short statement intended to emphasise the \"positive behaviours that make cricket an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship, and teamwork\".[127]Its second line states that, \"the major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all players, match officials and, especially injunior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents\".[126]\nThe umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play. They are required under the Laws to intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in cases of unacceptable conduct by a player.\nPrevious versions of the Spirit identified actions that were deemed contrary (for example, appealing knowing that the batter is not out), but all specifics are now covered in theLaws of Cricket, the relevant governing playing regulations and disciplinary codes, or left to the judgement of the umpires, captains, their clubs and governing bodies. The terse expression of the Spirit of Cricket now avoids trying to enumerate the diverse cultural conventions that exist in the detail of sportsmanship, or its absence.\nWomen's cricket was first recorded inSurreyin 1745.[128]International development began at the start of the 20th century, and the first Test match was played betweenAustraliaandEnglandin December 1934.[129]The following year,New Zealandjoined them, and in 2007Netherlandbecame the tenth women's Test nation when they made their debut againstSouth Africa. In 1958, the International Women's Cricket Council was founded (it merged with the ICC in 2005).[129]In 1973, the first Cricket World Cup of any kind took place when a Women's World Cup was held in England.[129]In 2005, theInternational Women's Cricket Councilwas merged with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form one unified body to help manage and develop cricket. The ICC Women's Rankings were launched on 1 October 2015 covering all three formats of women's cricket. In October 2018 following the ICC's decision to award T20 International status to all members, the Women's rankings were split into separateODI(for Full Members) and T20I lists.[130]\nTheInternational Cricket Council(ICC), which has its headquarters inDubai, is the global governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965 and took up its current name in 1989.[129]The ICC in 2017 has 105 member nations, twelve of which hold full membership and can playTest cricket.[131]The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, notably the men's and women's versions of theCricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, Limited Overs Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.\nEach member nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country, selects the national squad, and organises home and away tours for the national team.[132]In the West Indies, which for cricket purposes is a federation of nations, these matters are addressed byCricket West Indies.[133]\nThe table below lists the ICC full members and their national cricket boards:[134]\nCricket is a multifaceted sport with multiple formats that can effectively be divided intofirst-class cricket,limited overs cricket, and historically,single wicket cricket.\nThe highest standard isTest cricket(always written with a capital \"T\") which is in effect the international version of first-class cricket and is restricted to teams representing the twelve countries that are full members of the ICC (see above). Although the term \"Test match\" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches betweenAustraliaandEnglandin the1876\u201377 Australian season; since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known asThe Ashes. The term \"first-class\", in general usage, is applied to top-level domestic cricket. Test matches are played over five days and first-class over three to four days; in all of these matches, the teams are allotted two innings each and thedrawis a valid result.[136]\nLimited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day, and the teams are allotted one innings each. There are two main types:List Awhich normally allows fifty overs per team; andTwenty20in which the teams have twenty overs each. Both of the limited overs forms are played internationally asLimited Overs Internationals(LOI) andTwenty20 Internationals(T20I). List A was introduced in England in the 1963 season as a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was established. The concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971. In 1975, the firstCricket World Cuptook place in England. Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three to four hours, usually in an evening session. The firstTwenty20 World Championshipwas held in 2007. In addition, a few full-member cricket boards have decided to start leagues that are played in theT10 format,[137][138][139][140]in which games are intended to last approximately 90 minutes.[141][142]Most recently, in 2021, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) introduced a new league featuring a hundred-ball tournament, known asThe Hundred.[143]Limited overs matches cannot be drawn, although atieis possible and an unfinished match is a \"no result\".[144][145]\nSingle wicket was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, and its matches were generally considered top-class. In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batter in at a time, and that batter must face every delivery bowled while their innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began. Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first-class one and they could end in a draw.[146]\nCricket is played at both the international and domestic level. There is one major international championship per format, and top-level domestic competitions mirror the three main international formats. There are now a number ofT20 leagues, which have spawned a \"T20 freelancer\" phenomenon.[147]\nMost international matches are played as parts of 'tours', when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months, and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation. Sometimes aperpetual trophyis awarded to the winner of the Test series, the most famous of which isThe Ashes.\nThe ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including theICC Men's Cricket World Cup,ICC T20 World CupandICC Champions Trophy. A league competition for Test matches played as part of normal tours, theICC World Test Championship, had been proposed several times, and itsfirst instancebegan in 2019. A league competition forODIs, theICC Cricket World Cup Super League, began in August 2020 and lasted only for one edition. The ICC maintainsTest rankings,ODI rankingsandT20 rankingssystems for the countries which play these forms of cricket.\nCompetitions for member nations of the ICC withAssociate statusinclude theICC Intercontinental Cup, for first-class cricket matches, and theWorld Cricket Leaguefor one-day matches, the final matches of which now also serve as theICC World Cup Qualifier.\nThe game's only appearance in anOlympic Gameswas the1900 Olympics.[148]However, it is scheduled to make a return, with theT20format of the game, in the2028 Summer Olympicsin Los Angeles.[149][150]\nFirst-class cricket in England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest theCounty Championship. The concept of achampion countyhas existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until 1890.[47]The most successful club has beenYorkshire, who had won 32 official titles (plus one shared) as of 2019.[151]\nAustralia established its national first-class championship in 1892\u201393 when theSheffield Shieldwas introduced. In Australia, the first-class teams represent the various states.[152]New South Waleshas the highest number of titles.\nThe other ICC full members have national championship trophies called theAhmad Shah Abdali 4-day Tournament(Afghanistan); theNational Cricket League(Bangladesh); theRanji Trophy(India); theInter-Provincial Championship(Ireland); thePlunket Shield(New Zealand); theQuaid-e-Azam Trophy(Pakistan); theCurrie Cup(South Africa); thePremier Trophy(Sri Lanka); theShell Shield(West Indies); and theLogan Cup(Zimbabwe).\nThe world's earliest known cricket match was avillage cricketmeeting inKentwhich has been deduced from a 1640 court case recording a \"cricketing\" of \"the Weald and the Upland\" versus \"the Chalk Hill\" atChevening\"about thirty years since\" (i.e.,c.1611). Inter-parish contests became popular in the first half of the 17th century and continued to develop through the 18th with the first local leagues being founded in the second half of the 19th.[22]\nAt the grassroots level, localclub cricketis essentially an amateur pastime for those involved but still usually involves teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening.Schools cricket, first known in southern England in the 17th century, has a similar scenario and both are widely played in the countries where cricket is popular.[153]Although there can be variations in game format, compared with professional cricket, the Laws are always observed and club/school matches are therefore formal and competitive events.[154]The sport has numerous informal variants such asFrench cricket.[155]\nCricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in theCommonwealth of Nationsand elsewhere. It has, for example, influenced thelexiconof these nations, especially the English language, with various phrases such as \"that's not cricket\" (that's unfair), \"had a goodinnings\" (lived a long life), and \"sticky wicket\". \"On a sticky wicket\" (aka\"sticky dog\" or \"glue pot\")[156]is ametaphor[157]used to describe a difficult circumstance. It originated as a term for difficult batting conditions in cricket, caused by a damp and soft pitch.[158]\nCricket is the subject of works by noted English poets, includingWilliam BlakeandLord Byron.[159]Beyond a Boundary(1963), written by TrinidadianC. L. R. James, is often named the best book on any sport ever written.[160]\nIn the visual arts, notable cricket paintings includeAlbert Chevallier Tayler'sKent vs Lancashire at Canterbury(1907) andRussell Drysdale'sThe Cricketers(1948), which has been called \"possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century.\"[161]FrenchimpressionistCamille Pissarropainted cricket on a visit to England in the 1890s.[159]Francis Bacon, an avid cricket fan, captured a batter in motion.[159]CaribbeanartistWendy Nanan's cricket images[162]are featured in a limited edition first day cover forRoyal Mail's \"World of Invention\" stamp issue, which celebrated the London Cricket Conference 1\u20133 March 2007, first international workshop of its kind and part of the celebrations leading up to the 2007Cricket World Cup.[163]\nIn music, manycalypsosmake reference to theSport of Cricket.\nCricket has close historical ties withAustralian rules footballand many players havecompeted at top levels in both sports.[164]In 1858, prominent Australian cricketerTom Willscalled for the formation of a \"foot-ball club\" with \"a code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during the off-season. TheMelbourne Football Clubwas founded the following year, and Wills and three other members codified the first laws of the game.[165]It is typically played onmodified cricket fields.[166]\nIn England, a number ofassociation footballclubs owe their origins to cricketers who sought to play football as a means of keeping fit during the winter months.Derby Countywas founded as a branch of theDerbyshire County Cricket Clubin 1884;[167]Aston Villa(1874) andEverton(1876) were both founded by members of church cricket teams.[168]Sheffield United'sBramall Laneground was, from 1854, the home of theSheffield Cricket Club, and then ofYorkshire; it was not used for football until 1862 and was shared by Yorkshire and Sheffield United from 1889 to 1973.[169]\nIn the late 19th century, a former cricketer, English-bornHenry ChadwickofBrooklyn,New York, was credited with devising the baseballbox score[170](which he adapted from the cricket scorecard) for reporting game events. The first box score appeared in an 1859 issue of theClipper.[171]The statistical record is so central to the game's \"historical essence\" that Chadwick is sometimes referred to as \"the Father of Baseball\" because he facilitated the popularity of the sport in its early days.[172]\nThe influence ofEnglish sportssuch as cricket inBritish Indiaresulted in thelocal sportsbecoming standardised by the 1920s.[173]The 21st century success of theIndian Premier Leaguealso inspired the growth of other sports leagues in India,[174]with some of the native sports being further modernised, as with the popularPro Kabaddi League.[175]\nRelated sports", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_India": "Contents\nGeography of India\nGeological development\nPolitical geography\nPhysiographic regions\nRegions\nThe Himalayas\nThe Peninsular Plateau\nGhats\nIndo-Gangetic plain\nThar Desert\nCoastal plains\nIslands\nNatural resources\nEcological resources\nWater bodies\nWetlands\nArable land\nEconomic resources\nMinerals and ores\nRenewable water\nEnergy\nClimate\nGeology\nCratons\nSee also\nReferences\nBibliography\nFurther reading\n\nIndiais situated north of the equator between 8\u00b04' north (themainland) to 37\u00b06' north latitude and 68\u00b07' east to 97\u00b025' east longitude.[2]It is theseventh-largest country in the world, with a total area of 3,287,263 square kilometres (1,269,219\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[3][4][5]India measures 3,214\u00a0km (1,997\u00a0mi) from north to south and 2,933\u00a0km (1,822\u00a0mi) from east to west.

Geologically,Indialies on theIndian Plate, the northern part of theIndo-Australian Plate.\nIndia is situated entirely on theIndian Plate, a majortectonic platethat was formed when it split off from the ancient continentGondwanaland(ancient landmass, consisting of the southern part of the supercontinent ofPangea). TheIndo-Australian plateis subdivided into the Indian andAustralian plates. About 90 million years ago, during the lateCretaceous Period, the Indian Plate began moving north at about 15\u00a0cm/year (6 in/yr).[8]About 50 to 55 million years ago, in theEocene Epochof theCenozoic Era, the plate collided with Asia after covering a distance of 2,000 to 3,000\u00a0km (1,243 to 1,864\u00a0mi), having moved faster than any other known plate. In 2007, German geologists determined that the Indian Plate was able to move so quickly because it is only half as thick as the other plates which formerly constituted Gondwanaland.[9]The collision with theEurasian Platealong the modern border between India and Nepal formed theorogenic beltthat created theTibetan Plateauand theHimalayas. As of 2009[update], the Indian Plate is moving northeast at 5\u00a0cm/yr (2 in/yr), while theEurasian Plateis moving north at only 2\u00a0cm/yr (0.8 in/yr). India is thus referred to as the \"fastest continent\".[9]This is causing the Eurasian Plate to deform, and the Indian Plate to compress at a rate of 4\u00a0cm/yr (1.6 in/yr).\nIndia is divided into 28 States (further subdivided intodistricts) and 8union territoriesincluding the National capital territory (i.e.,Delhi).\nIndia's borders run a total length of 15,200\u00a0km (9,400\u00a0mi).[1][10]\nIts borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh were delineated according to theRadcliffe Line, which was created in 1947 duringPartition of India. Its western border with Pakistan extends up to 3,323\u00a0km (2,065\u00a0mi), dividing thePunjab regionand running along the boundaries of the Thar Desert and theRann of Kutch.[1]This border runs along the Indian states and union territories ofLadakh,Jammu and Kashmir,Punjab,Rajasthan, andGujarat.[11]Both nations delineated aLine of Control(LoC) to serve as the informal boundary between the Indian and Pakistan-administered areas of theKashmir region. India claims the whole of the former princely state ofJammu and Kashmir, which includes areas now administered by Pakistan and China, which according to India are illegally occupied areas.[1]\nIndia's border with Bangladesh runs 4,096.70\u00a0km (2,545.57\u00a0mi).[1]West Bengal,Assam,Meghalaya,TripuraandMizoramare the states which share the border with Bangladesh.[12]Before 2015, there were 92 enclaves of Bangladesh on Indian soil and 106 enclaves of India were on Bangladeshi soil.[13]Theseenclaveswere eventually exchanged in order to simplify the border.[14]After the exchange, India lost roughly 40\u00a0km2(9,900 acres) to Bangladesh.[15]\nTheLine of Actual Control(LAC) is the effective border between India and the People's Republic of China. It traverses 4,057\u00a0km along the Indian states and union territories ofLadakh,Himachal Pradesh,Uttarakhand,SikkimandArunachal Pradesh.[16]The border with Burma (Myanmar) extends up to 1,643\u00a0km (1,021\u00a0mi) along the easternborders of India's northeastern states viz.Arunachal Pradesh,Nagaland,ManipurandMizoram.[17]Located amidst the Himalayan range, India's border with Bhutan runs 699\u00a0km (434\u00a0mi).[1]Sikkim,West Bengal,AssamandArunachal Pradeshare the states which share the border with Bhutan.[18]The border withNepalruns 1,751\u00a0km (1,088\u00a0mi) along the foothills of the Himalayas in northern India.[1]Uttarakhand,Uttar Pradesh,Bihar,West BengalandSikkimare the states which share the border with Nepal.[19]TheSiliguri Corridor, narrowed sharply by the borders of Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh, connects peninsular India with the northeastern states.\nIndia can be divided into sixphysiographic regions. They are:\nAn arc of mountains consisting of the Himalayas,Hindu Kush, andPatkairanges define the northern frontiers of the Indian subcontinent.[20]These were formed by theongoing tectonic plates collisionof the Indian andEurasian plates. The mountains in these ranges include some of the world's tallest mountains which act as a barrier to cold polar winds. They also facilitate themonsoonwinds which in turn influence the climate in India. Rivers originating in these mountains flow through the fertile Indo\u2013Gangetic plains. These mountains form the boundary between twobiogeographic realms: thetemperatePalearctic realmthat covers most of Eurasia, and the tropical and subtropicalIndomalayan realmwhich includes South Asia,Southeast Asiaand Indonesia.[citation needed]\nThe Himalayas in India extend fromLadakhin the north to the state of Arunachal Pradesh in the east. Several Himalayanpeaks in Indiarise above 7,000\u00a0m (23,000\u00a0ft), includingKanchenjunga(8,598\u00a0m (28,209\u00a0ft)) on theSikkim\u2013Nepalborder, andNanda Devi(7,816\u00a0m (25,643\u00a0ft)) in theGarhwal Himalayasof Uttarakhand. Thesnow lineranges between 6,000\u00a0m (20,000\u00a0ft) in Sikkim to around 3,000\u00a0m (9,800\u00a0ft) in Ladakh. The Himalayas act as a barrier to the frigidkatabatic windsflowing down from Central Asia. Thus, northern India is kept warm or only mildly cooled during winter; in summer, the same phenomenon makes India relatively hot.[citation needed]\nThis is a large region of theIndian subcontinentlocated  between theWestern Ghatsand theEastern Ghats, and is loosely defined as the peninsular region between these ranges that is south of theNarmada River.Having once constituted a segment of the ancient continent ofGondwanaland, this land is the oldest and most stable in India.\nThe wordghati(Hindi:\u0918\u093e\u091f\u0940) means valley.[30]InMarathi, Hindi,GujaratiandKannada,ghatis a term used to identify a difficult passage over a mountain.[31]One such passage is theBhor Ghatthat connects the townsKhopoliandKhandala, onNH 4about 80 kilometres (50\u00a0mi) north ofMumbai.CharmadiGhat of Karnataka is also notable. In many cases, the term is used to refer to a mountain range itself, as in theWestern GhatsandEastern Ghats. 'Ghattam' in Malayalam also refers to mountain ranges when used with the name of the ranges being addressed (e.g., paschima ghattam for Western Ghats), while the passage road would be called a 'churam'.Eastern Ghatson the east coast of India andWestern Ghatson the west coast of India are the largest ghats in pensular India.[32]\nThe Indo-Gangetic[47]plains, also known as theGreat Plainsare largealluvial plainsdominated by three main rivers, theIndus,Ganges, andBrahmaputra. They run parallel to the Himalayas, fromJammu and Kashmirin the west toAssamin the east, drain most of northern and eastern India and extend into Pakistan. The plains encompass an area of 700,000\u00a0km2(270,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The major rivers in this region are the Ganges, Indus, and Brahmaputra along with their main tributaries\u2014Yamuna,Chambal,Gomti,Ghaghara,Kosi,Sutlej,Ravi,Beas,Chenab, andTista\u2014as well as the rivers of theGanges Delta, such as theMeghna.\nThe great plains are sometimes classified into four divisions:\nTheIndo-Gangetic beltis the world's most extensive expanse of uninterruptedalluviumformed by the deposition ofsiltby the numerous rivers. The plains are flat making it conducive forirrigationthroughcanals. The area is also rich inground watersources. The plains are one of the world's mostintensely farmedareas. The main crops grown arericeandwheat, which are grown inrotation. Other important crops grown in the region includemaize,sugarcaneandcotton. The Indo-Gangetic plains rank among the world's most densely populated areas.\nThe Thar Desert (also known asthe deserts) is by some calculations the world's seventh largest desert, by some others the tenth.[48]It forms a significant portion of western India and covers an area of 200,000 to 238,700\u00a0km2(77,200 to 92,200\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[49]The desert continues into Pakistan as theCholistan Desert. Most of the Thar Desert is situated inRajasthan, covering 61% of its geographic area.\nAbout 10 percent of this region consists of sand dunes, and the remaining 90 percent consist of craggy rock forms, compacted salt-lake bottoms, and interdunal and fixed dune areas. Annual temperatures can range from 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) in the winter to over 50\u00a0\u00b0C (122\u00a0\u00b0F) during the summer. Most of the rainfall received in this region is associated with the short July\u2013September southwest monsoon that brings 100 to 500\u00a0mm (3.9 to 19.7\u00a0in) of precipitation. Water is scarce and occurs at great depths, ranging from 30 to 120 metres (98 to 394\u00a0ft) below the ground level.[50]Rainfall is precarious and erratic, ranging from below 120\u00a0mm (4.7\u00a0in) in the extreme west to 375\u00a0mm (14.8\u00a0in) eastward. The only river in this region is Luni. The soils of the arid region are generally sandy to sandy-loam in texture. The consistency and depth vary as per the topographical features. The low-lying loams are heavier may have a hard pan of clay,calcium carbonateorgypsum.\nIn western India, the Kutch region in Gujarat and Koyna in Maharashtra are classified as a Zone IV region (high risk) for earthquakes. The Kutch city ofBhujwas theepicentreof the2001 Gujarat earthquake, which claimed the lives of more than 1,337 people and injured 166,836 while destroying or damaging near a million homes.[51]The1993 Latur earthquakein Maharashtra killed 7,928 people and injured 30,000.[52]Other areas have a moderate to low risk of an earthquake occurring.[53]\nThe Eastern Coastal Plain is a wide stretch of land lying between theEastern Ghatsand the oceanic boundary of India. It stretches fromTamil Naduin the south toWest Bengalin the east. TheMahanadi, Godavari, Kaveri, andKrishnarivers drain these plains. The temperature in the coastal regions often exceeds 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F), and is coupled with high levels ofhumidity. The region receives both thenortheast monsoonandsouthwest monsoonrains. The southwest monsoon splits into two branches, the Bay of Bengal branch and the Arabian Sea branch. The Bay of Bengal branch moves northwards crossing northeast India in early June. The Arabian Sea branch moves northwards and discharges much of its rain on the windward side of Western Ghats. Annual rainfall in this region averages between 1,000 and 3,000\u00a0mm (39 and 118\u00a0in). The width of the plains varies between 100 and 130\u00a0km (62 and 81\u00a0mi).[32]The plains are divided into six regions\u2014the Mahanadi delta, the southern Andhra Pradesh plain, the Krishna-Godavari deltas, theKanyakumaricoast, theCoromandel Coast, and sandy coastal.[citation needed]\nThe Western Coastal Plain is a narrow strip of land sandwiched between theWestern Ghatsand the Arabian Sea, ranging from 50 to 100\u00a0km (31 to 62\u00a0mi) in width. It extends from Gujarat in the north and extends through Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and Kerala. Numerous rivers and backwaters inundate the region. Mostly originating in the Western Ghats, the rivers are fast-flowing, usually perennial, and empty intoestuaries. Major rivers flowing into the sea are the Tapti, Narmada,MandoviandZuari. Vegetation is mostly deciduous, but theMalabar Coast moist forestsconstitute a unique ecoregion. The Western Coastal Plain can be divided into two parts, theKonkanand theMalabar Coast.\nTheLakshadweepand theAndaman and Nicobar Islandsare India's two major island formations and are classified asunion territories.\nTheLakshadweepIslands lie 200 to 440\u00a0km (120 to 270\u00a0mi) off the coast of Kerala in the Arabian sea with an area of 32\u00a0km2(12\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). They consist of twelve atolls, three reefs, and five submerged banks, with a total of about 35 islands and islets.\nTheAndaman and NicobarIslands are located between 6\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 north latitude and 92\u00b0 and 94\u00b0 east longitude.[54]They consist of 572 islands, lying in the Bay of Bengal near theMyanmarcoast running in a north\u2013south axis for approximately 910\u00a0km. They are located 1,255\u00a0km (780\u00a0mi) fromKolkata(Calcutta) and 193\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) fromCape Negraisin Burma.[54]The territory consists of two island groups, theAndaman Islandsand theNicobar Islands. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands consist of 572 islands which run in a north\u2013south axis for around 910\u00a0km. The Andaman group has 325 islands which cover an area of 6,170\u00a0km2(2,380\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) while the Nicobar group has only 247 islands with an area of 1,765\u00a0km2(681\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). India's only active volcano,Barren Islandis situated here. It last erupted in 2017. TheNarcondumis adormant volcanoand there is amud volcanoatBaratang.Indira Point, India's southernmost land point, is situated in the Nicobar islands at 6\u00b045\u201910\u2033N and 93\u00b049\u201936\u2033E, and lies just 189\u00a0km (117\u00a0mi) from the Indonesian island ofSumatra, to the southeast. The highest point isMount Thullierat 642\u00a0m (2,106\u00a0ft).\nOther significant islands in India includeDiu, a formerPortuguesecolony;Majuli,[55]a river island of the Brahmaputra;ElephantainBombay Harbour; andSriharikota, abarrier islandin Andhra Pradesh.Salsette Islandis India's most populous island on which the city ofMumbai(Bombay) is located. Forty-two islands in the Gulf of Kutch constitute theMarine National Park.\nMajor resource-based industries of India arefisheries, agriculture, mining, andpetroleum products.Indiahas the 18th-largestexclusive economic zone(EEZ) in the world with a total size of 2,305,143\u00a0km2(890,021 sq mi). It includes theLakshadweepisland group in theLaccadive Seaoff the southwestern coast of India and theAndaman and Nicobar Islandsin theBay of Bengaland theAndaman Sea.\nIndiawas ranked seventh among the list of countries most affected byclimate changein 2019.[56]Temperature rises on theTibetan Plateauare causingHimalayan glaciers to retreat, threatening the flow rate of theGanges,Brahmaputra,Indus,Yamunaand other major rivers. A 2007World Wide Fund for Nature(WWF) report states that theIndus Rivermay run dry for the same reason.[57]Severe landslides and floods are projected to become increasingly common in such states asAssam.[58]Temperatures in India have risen by 0.7\u00a0\u00b0C (1.3\u00a0\u00b0F) between 1901 and 2018.[59]According to some current projections, the number and severity ofdroughts in Indiawill have markedly increased by the end of the present century.[60]Ecological disasters, such as a 1998coral bleachingevent that killed off more than 70% of corals in the reef ecosystems offLakshadweepand theAndamansand was brought on by elevated ocean temperatures tied to global warming, are also projected to become increasingly common.[61][62]\nIndia has around 14,500\u00a0km of inland navigable waterways.[63]There are twelve rivers which are classified as major rivers, with the total catchment area exceeding 2,528,000\u00a0km2(976,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[28]All major rivers of Indiaoriginatefrom one of the three mainwatersheds:[28]\nThe Himalayan river networks are snow-fed and have a perennial supply throughout the year. The other two river systems are dependent on the monsoons and shrink into rivulets during the dry season. The Himalayan rivers that flow westward intoPunjabare theIndus,Jhelum,Chenab,Ravi,Beas, andSutlej.[64]\nTheGanges-Brahmaputra-Meghanasystem has the largest catchment area of about 1,600,000\u00a0km2(620,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[65]TheGanges Basinalone has a catchment of about 1,100,000\u00a0km2(420,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[28]The Ganges originates from theGangotri Glacierin Uttarakhand.[64]It flows southeast, draining into the Bay of Bengal.[28](TheYamunaandGomtirivers also arise in the western Himalayas and join the Ganges in the plains.[28]The Brahmaputra originates inTibet,China, where it is known as theYarlung Tsangpo River) (or \"Tsangpo\"). It enters India in the far-eastern state ofArunachal Pradesh, then flows west throughAssam. The Brahmaputra merges with the Ganges in Bangladesh, where it is known as theJamuna River.[28][66]\nTheChambal, another tributary of the Ganges, via the Yamuna, originates from the Vindhya-Satpura watershed. The river flows eastward. Westward-flowing rivers from this watershed are theNarmadaandTapi, which drain into the Arabian Sea in Gujarat. The river network that flows from east to west constitutes 10% of the total outflow.[clarification needed]\n(The Western Ghats are the source of all Deccan rivers, which include the throughGodavari River,Krishna RiverandKaveri River, all draining into the Bay of Bengal. These rivers constitute 20% of India's total outflow).[64]\nThe heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, such floods have killed thousands of people and tend to cause displacements of people in such areas.\nMajor gulfs include theGulf of Cambay,Gulf of Kutch, and theGulf of Mannar. Straits include thePalk Strait, which separates India from Sri Lanka; theTen Degree Channel, which separates the Andamans from the Nicobar Islands; and the Eight Degree Channel, which separates the Laccadive and Amindivi Islands from the Minicoy Island to the south. Important capes include theKanyakumari(formerly called Cape Comorin), the southern tip of mainland India;Indira Point, the southernmost point in India (onGreat NicobarIsland);Rama's Bridge, andPoint Calimere. The Arabian Sea lies to the west of India, the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean lie to the east and south, respectively. Smaller seas include theLaccadive Seaand theAndaman Sea. There are fourcoral reefsin India, located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Gulf of Mannar, Lakshadweep, and the Gulf of Kutch.[67]Important lakes includeSambhar Lake, the country's largest saltwater lake in Rajasthan,Vembanad Lakein Kerala,Kolleru Lakein Andhra Pradesh,Loktak LakeinManipur,Dal Lakein Kashmir,Chilka Lake(lagoon lake) in Odisha, andSasthamkotta Lakein Kerala.\nIndia'swetlandecosystem is widely distributed from the cold and arid located in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir, and those with the wet and humid climate of peninsular India. Most of the wetlands are directly or indirectly linked to river networks. The Indian government has identified a total of 71 wetlands for conservation and are part of sanctuaries and national parks.[68]Mangrove forests are present all along the Indian coastline in sheltered estuaries, creeks, backwaters, salt marshes and mudflats. The mangrove area covers a total of 4,461\u00a0km2(1,722\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[69]which comprises 7% of the world's total mangrove cover. Prominent mangrove covers are located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, theSundarbansdelta, theGulf of Kutchand the deltas of the Mahanadi, Godavari and Krishna rivers. Parts of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala also have large mangrove covers.[67]\nTheSundarbansdelta is home to the largest mangrove forest in the world. It lies at the mouth of the Ganges and spreads across areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. The Sundarbans is aUNESCOWorld Heritage Site, but is identified separately as the Sundarbans (Bangladesh) and theSundarbans National Park(India). The Sundarbans are intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests. The area is known for its diverse fauna, being home to a large variety of species of birds, spotted deer, crocodiles and snakes. Its most famous inhabitant is theBengal tiger. It is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.\nTheRann of Kutchis a marshy region located in northwestern Gujarat and the borderingSindhprovince of Pakistan. It occupies a total area of 27,900\u00a0km2(10,800\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[70]The region was originally a part of the Arabian Sea. Geologic forces such as earthquakes resulted in the damming up of the region, turning it into a large saltwater lagoon. This area gradually filled with silt thus turning it into a seasonal salt marsh. During the monsoons, the area turn into a shallow marsh, often flooding to knee-depth. After the monsoons, the region turns dry and becomes parched.\nIndia's arable land area of 1,597,000\u00a0km2(394.6 million acres) is the second largest in the world, after the United States. Its gross irrigated crop area of 826,000\u00a0km2(215.6 million acres) is the largest in the world, followed by US and China.[71]Of the 160 million hectares of cultivated land in India, about 39 million hectare can be irrigated by groundwater wells and an additional 22 million hectares by irrigation canals.[72]In 2010, only about 35% of agricultural land in India was reliably irrigated.[73]About 2/3rd cultivated land in India is dependent onmonsoons.[74]\nIndia is the world's biggest producer of mica blocks and mica splittings.[75]India ranks second amongst the world's largest producers of barite and chromite.[75]The Pleistocene system is rich in minerals. India is the third-largest coal producer in the world and ranks fourth in the production ofiron ore.[76][75]It is the fifth-largest producer of bauxite, second largest of crude steel as of February 2018 replacing Japan, the seventh-largest ofmanganese oreand the eighth-largest of aluminium.[75]India has significant sources of titanium ore, diamonds and limestone.[77]India possesses 24% of the world's known and economically viablethorium, which is mined along shores of Kerala.[78]Gold had been mined in the now-defunctKolar Gold Fieldsin Karnataka.[79]\nIndia's total renewable water resources are estimated at 1,907.8\u00a0km3a year.[80]Its annual supply of usable and replenishable groundwater amounts to 350 billion cubic metres.[81]Only 35% of groundwater resources are being utilised.[81]About 44 million tonnes of cargo is moved annually through the country's major rivers and waterways.[63]Groundwater supplies 40% of water in India's irrigation canals. 56% of the land is arable and used for agriculture. Black soils are moisture-retentive and are preferred for dry farming and growing cotton, linseed, etc. Forest soils are used for tea and coffee plantations. Red soils have a wide diffusion of iron content.[82]\nMost of India's estimated 5.4 billion barrels (860,000,000\u00a0m3) in oil reserves are located in theMumbai High,upper Assam,Cambay, theKrishna-GodavariandCauverybasins.[76]India possesses about seventeen trillion cubic feet ofnatural gasin Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Odisha.[76]Uraniumis mined in Andhra Pradesh. India has 400 medium-to-high enthalpythermal springsfor producinggeothermal energyin seven areas\u2014the Himalayas, Sohana, Cambay, the Narmada-Tapti delta, the Godavari delta and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (specifically the volcanicBarren Island.)[83]\nBased on theK\u00f6ppen system, India hosts six major climatic subtypes, ranging from arid desert in the west,alpine tundraand glaciers in the north, and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories. The nation has four seasons: winter (January\u2013February), summer (March\u2013May), a monsoon (rainy) season (June\u2013September) and a post-monsoon period (October\u2013December).[64]\nThe Himalayas act as a barrier to the frigidkatabatic windsflowing down from Central Asia. Thus, northern India is kept warm or only mildly cooled during winter; in summer, the same phenomenon makes India relatively hot. Although theTropic of Cancer\u2014the boundary between the tropics and subtropics\u2014passes through the middle of India, the whole country is considered to be tropical.[85]\nSummer lasts between March and June in most parts of India. Temperatures can exceed 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day. The coastal regions exceed 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) coupled with high levels ofhumidity. In the Thar desert area temperatures can exceed 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F). The rain-bearingmonsoonclouds are attracted to the low-pressure system created by the Thar Desert. The southwest monsoon splits into two arms, the Bay of Bengal arm and the Arabian Sea arm. The Bay of Bengal arm moves northwards crossing northeast India in early June. The Arabian Sea arm moves northwards and deposits much of its rain on the windward side of Western Ghats. Winters in peninsula India see mild to warm days and cool nights. Further north the temperature is cooler. Temperatures in some parts of the Indian plains sometimes fall below freezing. Most of northern India is plagued by fog during this season. The highest temperature recorded in India was 51\u00a0\u00b0C (124\u00a0\u00b0F) in Phalodi, Rajasthan.[86]And the lowest was \u221260\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221276\u00a0\u00b0F) in Dras, Jammu and Kashmir.[87]\nIndia's geological features are classified based on their era of formation.[88]ThePrecambrianformations of Cudappah and Vindhyan systems are spread out over the eastern and southern states. A small part of this period is spread over western and central India.[88]ThePaleozoicformations from the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian system are found in the Western Himalaya region in Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh.[88]TheMesozoicDeccan Trapsformation is seen over most of the northern Deccan; they are believed to be the result ofsub-aerialvolcanic activity.[88]The Trap soil is black in colour and conducive to agriculture. The Carboniferous system, Permian System and Triassic systems are seen in the western Himalayas. The Jurassic system is seen in the western Himalayas and Rajasthan.\nTertiaryimprints are seen in parts of Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and along the Himalayan belt. The Cretaceous system is seen in central India in the Vindhyas and part of the Indo-Gangetic plains.[88]The Gondwana system is seen in the Narmada River area in the Vindhyas and Satpuras. The Eocene system is seen in the western Himalayas and Assam. Oligocene formations are seen in Kutch and Assam.[88]ThePleistocenesystem is found over central India. The Andaman and Nicobar Island are thought to have been formed in this era by volcanoes.[88]The Himalayas were formed by the convergence and deformation of the Indo-Australian and Eurasian Plates. Their continued convergence raises the height of the Himalayas by one\u00a0centimetre each year.\nSoils in India can be classified into eight categories: alluvial, black, red, laterite, forest, arid and desert, saline and alkaline and peaty and organic soils.[89][90]Alluvial soil constitute the largest soil group in India, constituting 80% of the total land surface.[90]It is derived from the deposition of silt carried by rivers and are found in the Great Northern plains from Punjab to the Assam valley.[90]Alluvial soil are generally fertile but they lack nitrogen and tend to be phosphoric.[90]National Disaster Management Authoritysays that 60% of Indian landmass is prone toearthquakesand 8% susceptible to cyclone risks.\nBlack soil are well developed in the Deccan lava region of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh.[82]These contain high percentage of clay and are moisture retentive.[90]Red soils are found in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka plateau, Andhra plateau, Chota Nagpur plateau and the Aravallis.[82]These are deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus and humus.[90][82]Laterite soils are formed in tropical regions with heavy rainfall. Heavy rainfall results in leaching out all soluble material of top layer of soil. These are generally found in Western ghats, Eastern ghats and hilly areas of northeastern states that receive heavy rainfall.

But how do you gather large amounts of data from websites efficiently? That\u2019s wherePython web scrapingcomes in.Web scraping, the process of extracting data from websites, has emerged as a powerful technique to gather information from the vast expanse of the internet.\nIn this tutorial, we\u2019ll explore various Python libraries and modules commonly used for web scraping and delve into why Python 3 is the preferred choice for this task. Along with this you will also explore how to use powerful tools likeBeautifulSoup,Scrapy, andSeleniumto scrape any website.\nThe latest version ofPython, offers a rich set of tools and libraries specifically designed for web scraping, making it easier than ever to retrieve data from the web efficiently and effectively.\nTable of Content\nThe requests library is used for making HTTP requests to a specific URL and returns the response. Python requests provide inbuilt functionalities for managing both the request and response.\nPython requests module has several built-in methods to make HTTP requests to specified URI using GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or HEAD requests. A HTTP request is meant to either retrieve data from a specified URI or to push data to a server. It works as a request-response protocol between a client and a server. Here we will be using the GET request.\u00a0TheGET methodis used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request.\nOutput\n\nFor more information, refer to ourPython Requests Tutorial.\nBeautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic phrases for guiding, searching, and changing a parse tree: a toolkit for studying a document and removing what you need. It doesn\u2019t take much code to document an application.\nBeautiful Soup automatically converts incoming records to Unicode and outgoing forms to UTF-8. You don\u2019t have to think about encodings unless the document doesn\u2019t define an encoding, and Beautiful Soup can\u2019t catch one. Then you just have to choose the original encoding. Beautiful Soup sits on top of famous Python parsers like LXML and HTML, allowing you to try different parsing strategies or trade speed for flexibility.\nOutput\n\nNow, we would like to extract some useful data from the HTML content. The soup object contains all the data in the nested structure which could be programmatically extracted. The website we want to scrape contains a lot of text so now let\u2019s scrape all those content. First, let\u2019s inspect the webpage we want to scrape.\n\n\nIn the above image, we can see that all the content of the page is under the div with class entry-content. We will use the find class. This class will find the given tag with the given attribute. In our case, it will find all the div having class as entry-content.\nWe can see that the content of the page is under the <p> tag. Now we have to find all the p tags present in this class. We can use thefind_allclass of the BeautifulSoup.\nOutput:\n\nFor more information, refer to ourPython BeautifulSoup.\nSelenium is a popular Python module used for automating web browsers. It allows developers to control web browsers programmatically, enabling tasks such as web scraping, automated testing, and web application interaction. Selenium supports various web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, making it a versatile tool for browser automation.\nIn this specific example, we\u2019re directing the browser to the Google search page with the query parameter \u201cgeeksforgeeks\u201d. The browser will load this page, and we can then proceed to interact with it programmatically using Selenium. This interaction could involve tasks like extracting search results, clicking on links, or scraping specific content from the page.\nOutput\n\nOutput\n\nFor more information, refer to ourPython Selenium.\nThe lxml module in Python is a powerful library for processing XML and HTML documents. It provides a high-performance XML and HTML parsing capabilities along with a simple and Pythonic API. lxml is widely used in Python web scraping due to its speed, flexibility, and ease of use.\nHere\u2019s a simple example demonstrating how to use the lxml module for Python web scraping:\nOutput\nThe urllib module in Python is a built-in library that provides functions for working with URLs. It allows you to interact with web pages by fetching URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), opening and reading data from them, and performing other URL-related tasks like encoding and parsing. Urllib is a package that collects several modules for working with URLs, such as:\nIf urllib is not present in your environment, execute the below code to install it.\nHere\u2019s a simple example demonstrating how to use the urllib module to fetch the content of a web page:\nOutput\n\nThe pyautogui module in Python is a cross-platform GUI automation library that enables developers to control the mouse and keyboard to automate tasks. While it\u2019s not specifically designed for web scraping, it can be used in conjunction with other web scraping libraries like Selenium to interact with web pages that require user input or simulate human actions.\nIn this example, pyautogui is used to perform scrolling and take a screenshot of the search results page obtained by typing a query into the search input field and clicking the search button using Selenium.\nOutput\n\nThe schedule module in Python is a simple library that allows you to schedule Python functions to run at specified intervals. It\u2019s particularly useful in web scraping in Python when you need to regularly scrape data from a website at predefined intervals, such as hourly, daily, or weekly.\nOutput\n\nPython\u2019s popularity for web scraping stems from several factors:\nEase of Use: Python\u2019s clean and readable syntax makes it easy to understand and write code, even for beginners. This simplicity accelerates the development process and reduces the learning curve for web scraping tasks.\nRich Ecosystem: Python boasts a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks tailored for web scraping. Libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Requests simplify the process of parsing HTML, making data extraction a breeze.\nVersatility: Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of tasks beyond web scraping. Its flexibility allows developers to integrate web scraping seamlessly into larger projects, such as data analysis, machine learning, or web development.\nCommunity Support: Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its libraries and provide support through forums, tutorials, and documentation. This wealth of resources ensures that developers have access to assistance and guidance when tackling web scraping challenges.\nthis tutorial has shown you the basics of how to use Python for web scraping. With the tools we\u2019ve discussed, you can start collecting data from the internet quickly and easily. Whether you need this data for a project, research, or just for fun, Python makes it possible. Remember to always scrape data responsibly and follow the rules set by websites. If you\u2019re excited to learn more about Python and web scraping, check out ourPython Course.

With powerful libraries likeurllib, Beautiful Soup, and MechanicalSoup, you can fetch and manipulate HTML content effortlessly. By automating data collection tasks, Python makes web scraping both efficient and effective.\nYou can build a Python web scraping workflow using only the standard library by fetching a web page withurlliband extracting data using string methods or regular expressions. For more complex HTML or more robust workflows, you can use the third-party library Beautiful Soup, which simplifies HTML parsing. By adding MechanicalSoup to your toolkit, you can even enable interactions with HTML forms.\nBy the end of this tutorial, you\u2019ll understand that:\nThis tutorial guides you through extracting data from websites using string methods, regular expressions, and HTML parsers.\nNote:This tutorial is adapted from the chapter \u201cInteracting With the Web\u201d inPython Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3.\nThe book uses Python\u2019s built-inIDLEeditor to create and edit Python files and interact with the Python shell, so you\u2019ll see occasional references to IDLE throughout this tutorial. However, you should have no problems running the example code from theeditorandenvironmentof your choice.\nSource Code:Click here to download the free source codethat you\u2019ll use to collect and parse data from the Web.\nTake the Quiz:Test your knowledge with our interactive \u201cA Practical Introduction to Web Scraping in Python\u201d quiz. You\u2019ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress:\nInteractive Quiz\nIn this quiz, you'll test your understanding of web scraping in Python. Web scraping is a powerful tool for data collection and analysis. By working through this quiz, you'll revisit how to parse website data using string methods, regular expressions, and HTML parsers, as well as how to interact with forms and other website components.\nCollecting data from websites using an automated process is known as web scraping. Some websites explicitly forbid users from scraping their data with automated tools like the ones that you\u2019ll create in this tutorial. Websites do this for two possible reasons:\nBefore using your Python skills for web scraping, you should always check your target website\u2019s acceptable use policy to see if accessing the website with automated tools is a violation of its terms of use. Legally, web scraping against the wishes of a website is very much a gray area.\nImportant:Please be aware that the following techniquesmay be illegalwhen used on websites that prohibit web scraping.\nFor this tutorial, you\u2019ll use a page that\u2019s hosted on Real Python\u2019s server. The page that you\u2019ll access has been set up for use with this tutorial.\nNow that you\u2019ve read the disclaimer, you can get to the fun stuff. In the next section, you\u2019ll start grabbing all the HTML code from a single web page.\nOne useful package for web scraping that you can find in Python\u2019sstandard libraryisurllib, which contains tools for working with URLs. In particular, theurllib.requestmodule contains a function calledurlopen()that you can use to open a URL within a program.\nIn IDLE\u2019s interactive window, type the following to importurlopen():\nThe web page that you\u2019ll open is at the following URL:\nTo open the web page, passurltourlopen():\nurlopen()returns anHTTPResponseobject:\nTo extract the HTML from the page, first use theHTTPResponseobject\u2019s.read()method, which returns a sequence of bytes. Then use.decode()to decode the bytes to a string usingUTF-8:\nNow you canprintthe HTML to see the contents of the web page:\nThe output that you\u2019re seeing is theHTML codeof the website, which your browser renders when you visithttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/aphrodite:\nWithurllib, you accessed the website similarly to how you would in your browser. However, instead of rendering the content visually, you grabbed the source code as text. Now that you have the HTML as text, you can extract information from it in a couple of different ways.\nOne way to extract information from a web page\u2019s HTML is to usestring methods. For instance, you can use.find()to search through the text of the HTML for the<title>tags and extract the title of the web page.\nTo start, you\u2019ll extract the title of the web page that you requested in the previous example. If you know the index of the first character of the title and the index of the first character of the closing</title>tag, then you can use astring sliceto extract the title.\nBecause.find()returns the index of the first occurrence of asubstring, you can get the index of the opening<title>tag by passing the string\"<title>\"to.find():\nYou don\u2019t want the index of the<title>tag, though. You want the index of the title itself. To get the index of the first letter in the title, you can add the length of the string\"<title>\"totitle_index:\nNow get the index of the closing</title>tag by passing the string\"</title>\"to.find():\nFinally, you can extract the title by slicing thehtmlstring:\nReal-world HTML can be much more complicated and far less predictable than the HTML on the Aphrodite profile page. Here\u2019sanother profile pagewith some messier HTML that you can scrape:\nTry extracting the title from this new URL using the same method as in the previous example:\nWhoops! There\u2019s a bit of HTML mixed in with the title. Why\u2019s that?\nThe HTML for the/profiles/poseidonpage looks similar to the/profiles/aphroditepage, but there\u2019s a small difference. The opening<title>tag has an extra space before the closing angle bracket (>), rendering it as<title >.\nhtml.find(\"<title>\")returns-1because the exact substring\"<title>\"doesn\u2019t exist. When-1is added tolen(\"<title>\"), which is7, thestart_indexvariable is assigned the value6.\nThe character at index6of the stringhtmlis a newline character (\\n) right before the opening angle bracket (<) of the<head>tag. This means thathtml[start_index:end_index]returns all the HTML starting with that newline and ending just before the</title>tag.\nThese sorts of problems can occur in countless unpredictable ways. You need a more reliable way to extract text from HTML.\nRegular expressions\u2014orregexesfor short\u2014are patterns that you can use to search for text within a string. Python supports regular expressions through the standard library\u2019sremodule.\nNote:Regular expressions aren\u2019t particular to Python. They\u2019re a general programming concept and are supported in many programming languages.\nTo work with regular expressions, the first thing that you need to do is import theremodule:\nRegular expressions use special characters calledmetacharactersto denote different patterns. For instance, the asterisk character (*) stands for zero or more instances of whatever comes just before the asterisk.\nIn the following example, you use.findall()to find any text within a string that matches a given regular expression:\nThe first argument ofre.findall()is the regular expression that you want to match, and the second argument is the string to test. In the above example, you search for the pattern\"ab*c\"in the string\"ac\".\nThe regular expression\"ab*c\"matches any part of the string that begins with\"a\", ends with\"c\", and has zero or more instances of\"b\"between the two.re.findall()returns alistof all matches. The string\"ac\"matches this pattern, so it\u2019s returned in the list.\nHere\u2019s the same pattern applied to different strings:\nNotice that if no match is found, then.findall()returns an empty list.\nPattern matching is case sensitive. If you want to match this pattern regardless of the case, then you can pass a third argument with the valuere.IGNORECASE:\nYou can use a period (.) to stand for any single character in a regular expression. For instance, you could find all the strings that contain the letters\"a\"and\"c\"separated by a single character as follows:\nThe pattern.*inside a regular expression stands for any character repeated any number of times. For instance, you can use\"a.*c\"to find every substring that starts with\"a\"and ends with\"c\", regardless of which letter\u2014or letters\u2014are in between:\nOften, you usere.search()to search for a particular pattern inside a string. This function is somewhat more complicated thanre.findall()because it returns an object calledMatchObjectthat stores different groups of data. This is because there might be matches inside other matches, andre.search()returns every possible result.\nThe details ofMatchObjectare irrelevant here. For now, just know that calling.group()onMatchObjectwill return the first and most inclusive result, which in most cases is just what you want:\nThere\u2019s one more function in theremodule that\u2019s useful for parsing out text.re.sub(), which is short forsubstitute, allows you to replace the text in a string that matches a regular expression with new text. It behaves sort of like the.replace()string method.\nThe arguments passed tore.sub()are the regular expression, followed by the replacement text, followed by the string. Here\u2019s an example:\nPerhaps that wasn\u2019t quite what you expected to happen.\nre.sub()uses the regular expression\"<.*>\"to find and replace everything between the first<and the last>, which spans from the beginning of<replaced>to the end of<tags>. This is because Python\u2019s regular expressions aregreedy, meaning they try to find the longest possible match when characters like*are used.\nAlternatively, you can use the non-greedy matching pattern*?, which works the same way as*except that it matches the shortest possible string of text:\nThis time,re.sub()finds two matches,<replaced>and<tags>, and substitutes the string\"ELEPHANTS\"for both matches.\nEquipped with all this knowledge, now try to parse out the title fromanother profile page, which includes this rather carelessly written line of HTML:\nThe.find()method would have a difficult time dealing with the inconsistencies here, but with the clever use of regular expressions, you can handle this code quickly and efficiently:\nTake a closer look at the first regular expression in thepatternstring by breaking it down into three parts:\n<title.*?>matches the opening<TITLE >tag inhtml. The<titlepart of the pattern matches with<TITLEbecausere.search()is called withre.IGNORECASE, and.*?>matches any text after<TITLEup to the first instance of>.\n.*?non-greedily matches all text after the opening<TITLE >, stopping at the first match for</title.*?>.\n</title.*?>differs from the first pattern only in its use of the/character, so it matches the closing</title  / >tag inhtml.\nThe second regular expression, the string\"<.*?>\", also uses the non-greedy.*?to match all the HTML tags in thetitlestring. By replacing any matches with\"\",re.sub()removes all the tags and returns only the text.\nNote:Web scraping in Python or any other language can be tedious. No two websites are organized the same way, and HTML is often messy. Moreover, websites change over time. Web scrapers that work today aren\u2019t guaranteed to work next year\u2014or next week, for that matter!\nRegular expressions are a powerful tool when used correctly. In this introduction, you\u2019ve barely scratched the surface. For more about regular expressions and how to use them, check out the two-part seriesRegular Expressions: Regexes in Python.\nExpand the block below to check your understanding.\nExercise: Scrape Data From a WebsiteShow/Hide\nWrite a program that grabs the full HTML from the following URL:\nThen use.find()to display the text followingName:andFavorite Color:(not including any leading spaces or trailing HTML tags that might appear on the same line).\nYou can expand the block below to see a solution.\nSolution: Scrape Data From a WebsiteShow/Hide\nFirst, import theurlopenfunction from theurlib.requestmodule:\nThen open the URL and use the.read()method of theHTTPResponseobject returned byurlopen()to read the page\u2019s HTML:\nThe.read()method returns a byte string, so you use.decode()to decode the bytes using the UTF-8 encoding.\nNow that you have the HTML source of the web page as a string assigned to thehtml_textvariable, you can extract Dionysus\u2019s name and favorite color from his profile. The structure of the HTML for Dionysus\u2019s profile is the same as for Aphrodite\u2019s profile, which you saw earlier.\nYou can get the name by finding the string\"Name:\"in the text and extracting everything that comes after the first occurence of the string and before the next HTML tag. That is, you need to extract everything after the colon (:) and before the first angle bracket (<). You can use the same technique to extract the favorite color.\nThe followingforloopextracts this text for both the name and favorite color:\nIt looks like there\u2019s a lot going on in thisforloop, but it\u2019s just a little bit of arithmetic to calculate the right indices for extracting the desired text. Go ahead and break it down:\nYou usehtml_text.find()to find the starting index of the string, either\"Name:\"or\"Favorite Color:\", and then assign the index tostring_start_idx.\nSince the text to extract starts just after the colon in\"Name:\"or\"Favorite Color:\", you get the index of the character immediately after the colon by adding the length of the string tostart_string_idx, and then assign the result totext_start_idx.\nYou calculate the ending index of the text to extract by determining the index of the first angle bracket (<) relative totext_start_idxand assign this value tonext_html_tag_offset. Then you add that value totext_start_idxand assign the result totext_end_idx.\nYou extract the text by slicinghtml_textfromtext_start_idxtotext_end_idxand assign this string toraw_text.\nYou remove any whitespace from the beginning and end ofraw_textusing.strip()and assign the result toclean_text.\nAt the end of the loop, you useprint()to display the extracted text. The final output looks like this:\nThis solution is one of many that solves this problem, so if you got the same output with a different solution, then you did great!\nWhen you\u2019re ready, you can move on to the next section.\nAlthough regular expressions are great for pattern matching in general, sometimes it\u2019s easier to use an HTML parser that\u2019s explicitly designed for parsing out HTML pages. There are many Python tools written for this purpose, but theBeautiful Souplibrary is a good one to start with.\nTo install Beautiful Soup, you can run the following in yourterminal:\nWith this command, you\u2019re installing the latest version of Beautiful Soup into your global Python environment.\nType the following program into a new editor window:\nThis program does three things:\nOpens the URLhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles/dionysusby usingurlopen()from theurllib.requestmodule\nReads the HTML from the page as a string and assigns it to thehtmlvariable\nCreates aBeautifulSoupobject and assigns it to thesoupvariable\nTheBeautifulSoupobject assigned tosoupis created with two arguments. The first argument is the HTML to be parsed, and the second argument, the string\"html.parser\", tells the object which parser to use behind the scenes.\"html.parser\"represents Python\u2019s built-in HTML parser.\nSave and run the above program. When it\u2019s finished running, you can use thesoupvariable in the interactive window to parse the content ofhtmlin various ways.\nNote:If you\u2019re not using IDLE, then you can run your program with the-iflag to enter interactive mode. Something likepython -i beauty_soup.pywill first run your program and then leave you in a REPL where you can explore your objects.\nFor example,BeautifulSoupobjects have a.get_text()method that you can use to extract all the text from the document and automatically remove any HTML tags.\nType the following code into IDLE\u2019s interactive window or at the end of the code in your editor:\nThere are a lot of blank lines in this output. These are the result of newline characters in the HTML document\u2019s text. You can remove them with the.replace()string method if you need to.\nOften, you need to get only specific text from an HTML document. Using Beautiful Soup first to extract the text and then using the.find()string method is sometimes easier than working with regular expressions.\nHowever, other times the HTML tags themselves are the elements that point out the data you want to retrieve. For instance, perhaps you want to retrieve the URLs for all the images on the page. These links are contained in thesrcattribute of<img>HTML tags.\nIn this case, you can usefind_all()to return a list of all instances of that particular tag:\nThis returns a list of all<img>tags in the HTML document. The objects in the list look like they might be strings representing the tags, but they\u2019re actually instances of theTagobject provided by Beautiful Soup.Tagobjects provide a simple interface for working with the information they contain.\nYou can explore this a little by first unpacking theTagobjects from the list:\nEachTagobject has a.nameproperty that returns a string containing the HTML tag type:\nYou can access the HTML attributes of theTagobject by putting their names between square brackets, just as if the attributes were keys in a dictionary.\nFor example, the<img src=\"/static/dionysus.jpg\"/>tag has a single attribute,src, with the value\"/static/dionysus.jpg\". Likewise, an HTML tag such as the link<a href=\"https://realpython.com\" target=\"_blank\">has two attributes,hrefandtarget.\nTo get the source of the images in the Dionysus profile page, you access thesrcattribute using the dictionary notation mentioned above:\nCertain tags in HTML documents can be accessed by properties of theTagobject. For example, to get the<title>tag in a document, you can use the.titleproperty:\nIf you look at the source of the Dionysus profile by navigating to theprofile page, right-clicking on the page, and selectingView page source, then you\u2019ll notice that the<title>tag is written in all caps with spaces:\nBeautiful Soup automatically cleans up the tags for you by removing the extra space in the opening tag and the extraneous forward slash (/) in the closing tag.\nYou can also retrieve just the string between the title tags with the.stringproperty of theTagobject:\nOne of the features of Beautiful Soup is the ability to search for specific kinds of tags whose attributes match certain values. For example, if you want to find all the<img>tags that have asrcattribute equal to the value/static/dionysus.jpg, then you can provide the following additional argument to.find_all():\nThis example is somewhat arbitrary, and the usefulness of this technique may not be apparent from the example. If you spend some time browsing various websites and viewing their page sources, then you\u2019ll notice that many websites have extremely complicated HTML structures.\nWhen scraping data from websites with Python, you\u2019re often interested in particular parts of the page. By spending some time looking through the HTML document, you can identify tags with unique attributes that you can use to extract the data you need.\nThen, instead of relying on complicated regular expressions or using.find()to search through the document, you can directly access the particular tag that you\u2019re interested in and extract the data you need.\nIn some cases, you may find that Beautiful Soup doesn\u2019t offer the functionality you need. Thelxmllibrary is somewhat trickier to get started with but offers far more flexibility than Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML documents. You may want to check it out once you\u2019re comfortable using Beautiful Soup.\nNote:HTML parsers like Beautiful Soup can save you a lot of time and effort when it comes to locating specific data in web pages. However, sometimes HTML is so poorly written and disorganized that even a sophisticated parser like Beautiful Soup can\u2019t interpret the HTML tags properly.\nIn this case, you\u2019re often left with using.find()and regular expression techniques to try to parse out the information that you need.\nBeautiful Soup is great for scraping data from a website\u2019s HTML, but it doesn\u2019t provide any way to work with HTML forms. For example, if you need to search a website for some query and then scrape the results, then Beautiful Soup alone won\u2019t get you very far.\nExpand the block below to check your understanding.\nExercise: Parse HTML With Beautiful SoupShow/Hide\nWrite a program that grabs the full HTML from thepageat the URLhttp://olympus.realpython.org/profiles.\nUsing Beautiful Soup, print out a list of all the links on the page by looking for HTML tags with the nameaand retrieving the value taken on by thehrefattribute of each tag.\nThe final output should look like this:\nMake sure that you only have one slash (/) between the base URL and the relative URL.\nYou can expand the block below to see a solution:\nSolution: Parse HTML With Beautiful SoupShow/Hide\nFirst, import theurlopenfunction from theurlib.requestmodule and theBeautifulSoupclass from thebs4package:\nEach link URL on the/profilespage is arelative URL, so create abase_urlvariable with the base URL of the website:\nYou can build a full URL by concatenatingbase_urlwith a relative URL.\nNow open the/profilespage withurlopen()and use.read()to get the HTML source:\nWith the HTML source downloaded and decoded, you can create a newBeautifulSoupobject to parse the HTML:\nsoup.find_all(\"a\")returns a list of all the links in the HTML source. You can loop over this list to print out all the links on the web page:\nYou can access the relative URL for each link through the\"href\"subscript. Concatenate this value withbase_urlto create the fulllink_url.\nWhen you\u2019re ready, you can move on to the next section.\nTheurllibmodule that you\u2019ve been working with so far in this tutorial is well suited for requesting the contents of a web page. Sometimes, though, you need to interact with a web page to obtain the content you need. For example, you might need to submit a form or click a button to display hidden content.\nNote:This tutorial is adapted from the chapter \u201cInteracting With the Web\u201d inPython Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3. If you enjoy what you\u2019re reading, then be sure to check outthe rest of the book.\nThe Python standard library doesn\u2019t provide a built-in means for working with web pages interactively, but many third-party packages are available fromPyPI. Among these,MechanicalSoupis a popular and relatively straightforward package to use.\nIn essence, MechanicalSoup installs what\u2019s known as aheadless browser, which is a web browser with no graphical user interface. This browser is controlled programmatically via a Python program.\nYou can install MechanicalSoup withpipin your terminal:\nYou\u2019ll need to close and restart your IDLE session for MechanicalSoup to load and be recognized after it\u2019s been installed.\nType the following into IDLE\u2019s interactive window:\nBrowserobjects represent the headless web browser. You can use them to request a page from the Internet by passing a URL to their.get()method:\npageis aResponseobject that stores the response from requesting the URL from the browser:\nThe number200represents thestatus codereturned by the request. A status code of200means that the request was successful. An unsuccessful request might show a status code of404if the URL doesn\u2019t exist or500if there\u2019s a server error when making the request.\nMechanicalSoup uses Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML from the request, andpagehas a.soupattribute that represents aBeautifulSoupobject:\nYou can view the HTML by inspecting the.soupattribute:\nNotice this page has a<form>on it with<input>elements for a username and a password.\nOpen the/loginpage from the previous example in a browser and look at it yourself before moving on:\nTry typing in a random username and password combination. If you guess incorrectly, then the messageWrong username or password!is displayed at the bottom of the page.\nHowever, if you provide the correct login credentials, then you\u2019re redirected to the/profilespage:\nIn the next example, you\u2019ll see how to use MechanicalSoup to fill out and submit this form using Python!\nThe important section of HTML code is the login form\u2014that is, everything inside the<form>tags. The<form>on this page has thenameattribute set tologin. This form contains two<input>elements, one nameduserand the other namedpwd. The third<input>element is theSubmitbutton.\nNow that you know the underlying structure of the login form, as well as the credentials needed to log in, take a look at a program that fills the form out and submits it.\nIn a new editor window, type in the following program:\nSave the file and pressF5to run it. To confirm that you\u2019ve successfully logged in, type the following into the interactive window:\nNow break down the above example:\nYou create aBrowserinstance and use it to request the URLhttp://olympus.realpython.org/login. You assign the HTML content of the page to thelogin_htmlvariable using the.soupproperty.\nlogin_html.select(\"form\")returns a list of all<form>elements on the page. Because the page has only one<form>element, you can access the form by retrieving the element at index0of the list. When there is only one form on a page, you may also uselogin_html.form. The next two lines select the username and password inputs and set their value to\"zeus\"and\"ThunderDude\", respectively.\nYou submit the form withbrowser.submit(). Notice that you pass two arguments to this method, theformobject and the URL of thelogin_page, which you access vialogin_page.url.\nIn the interactive window, you confirm that the submission successfully redirected to the/profilespage. If something had gone wrong, then the value ofprofiles_page.urlwould still be\"http://olympus.realpython.org/login\".\nNote:Hackers can use automated programs like the one above tobrute forcelogins by rapidly trying many different usernames and passwords until they find a working combination.\nBesides this being highly illegal, almost all websites these days lock you out and report your IP address if they see you making too many failed requests, so don\u2019t try it!\nNow that you have theprofiles_pagevariable set, it\u2019s time to programmatically obtain the URL for each link on the/profilespage.\nTo do this, you use.select()again, this time passing the string\"a\"to select all the<a>anchor elements on the page:\nNow you can iterate over each link and print thehrefattribute:\nThe URLs contained in eachhrefattribute are relative URLs, which aren\u2019t very helpful if you want to navigate to them later using MechanicalSoup. If you happen to know the full URL, then you can assign the portion needed to construct a full URL.\nIn this case, the base URL is justhttp://olympus.realpython.org. Then you can concatenate the base URL with the relative URLs found in thesrcattribute:\nYou can do a lot with just.get(),.select(), and.submit(). That said, MechanicalSoup is capable of much more. To learn more about MechanicalSoup, check out theofficial docs.\nExpand the block below to check your understanding\nExercise: Submit a Form With MechanicalSoupShow/Hide\nUse MechanicalSoup to provide the correct username (zeus) and password (ThunderDude) to thelogin formlocated at the URLhttp://olympus.realpython.org/login.\nOnce the form is submitted, display the title of the current page to determine that you\u2019ve been redirected to the/profilespage.\nYour program should print the text<title>All Profiles</title>.\nYou can expand the block below to see a solution.\nSolution: Submit a Form With MechanicalSoupShow/Hide\nFirst, import themechanicalsouppackage and create aBroswerobject:\nPoint the browser to the login page by passing the URL tobrowser.get()and grab the HTML with the.soupattribute:\nlogin_htmlis aBeautifulSoupinstance. Because the page has only a single form on it, you can access the form vialogin_html.form. Using.select(), select the username and password inputs and fill them with the username\"zeus\"and the password\"ThunderDude\":\nNow that the form is filled out, you can submit it withbrowser.submit():\nIf you filled the form with the correct username and password, thenprofiles_pageshould actually point to the/profilespage. You can confirm this by printing the title of the page assigned toprofiles_page:\nYou should see the following text displayed:\nIf instead you see the textLog Inor something else, then the form submission failed.\nWhen you\u2019re ready, you can move on to the next section.\nSometimes you want to be able to fetch real-time data from a website that offers continually updated information.\nIn the dark days before you learned Python programming, you had to sit in front of a browser, clicking theRefreshbutton to reload the page each time you wanted to check if updated content was available. But now you can automate this process using the.get()method of the MechanicalSoupBrowserobject.\nOpen your browser of choice and navigate to the URLhttp://olympus.realpython.org/dice:\nThis/dicepage simulates a roll of a six-sided die, updating the result each time you refresh the browser. Below, you\u2019ll write a program that repeatedly scrapes the page for a new result.\nThe first thing you need to do is determine which element on the page contains the result of the die roll. Do this now by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selectingView page source. A little more than halfway down the HTML code is an<h2>tag that looks like this:\nThe text of the<h2>tag might be different for you, but this is the page element you need for scraping the result.\nNote:For this example, you can easily check that there\u2019s only one element on the page withid=\"result\". Although theidattribute is supposed to be unique, in practice you should always check that the element you\u2019re interested in is uniquely identified.\nNow start by writing a simple program that opens the/dicepage, scrapes the result, and prints it to the console:\nThis example uses theBeautifulSoupobject\u2019s.select()method to find the element withid=result. The string\"#result\", which you pass to.select(), uses theCSS ID selector#to indicate thatresultis anidvalue.\nTo periodically get a new result, you\u2019ll need to create a loop that loads the page at each step. So everything below the linebrowser = mechanicalsoup.Browser()in the above code needs to go in the body of the loop.\nFor this example, you want four rolls of the dice at ten-second intervals. To do that, the last line of your code needs to tell Python to pause running for ten seconds. You can do this with.sleep()from Python\u2019stimemodule. The.sleep()method takes a single argument that represents the amount of time to sleep in seconds.\nHere\u2019s an example that illustrates howsleep()works:\nWhen you run this code, you\u2019ll see that the\"Done waiting!\"message isn\u2019t displayed until five seconds have passed from when the firstprint()function was executed.\nFor the die roll example, you\u2019ll need to pass the number10tosleep(). Here\u2019s the updated program:\nWhen you run the program, you\u2019ll immediately see the first result printed to the console. After ten seconds, the second result is displayed, then the third, and finally the fourth. What happens after the fourth result is printed?\nThe program continues running for another ten seconds before it finally stops. That\u2019s kind of a waste of time! You can stop it from doing this by using anifstatementto runtime.sleep()for only the first three requests:\nWith techniques like this, you can scrape data from websites that periodically update their data. However, you should be aware that requesting a page multiple times in rapid succession can be seen as suspicious, or even malicious, use of a website.\nImportant:Most websites publish a Terms of Use document. You can often find a link to it in the website\u2019s footer.\nAlways read this document before attempting to scrape data from a website. If you can\u2019t find the Terms of Use, then try to contact the website owner and ask them if they have any policies regarding request volume.\nFailure to comply with the Terms of Use could result in your IP being blocked, so be careful!\nIt\u2019s even possible to crash a server with an excessive number of requests, so you can imagine that many websites are concerned about the volume of requests to their server! Always check the Terms of Use and be respectful when sending multiple requests to a website.\nAlthough it\u2019s possible to parse data from the Web using tools in Python\u2019s standard library, there are many tools on PyPI that can help simplify the process.\nIn this tutorial, you learned how to:\nWriting automated web scraping programs is fun, and the Internet has no shortage of content that can lead to all sorts of exciting projects.\nJust remember, not everyone wants you pulling data from their web servers. Always check a website\u2019s Terms of Use before you start scraping, and be respectful about how you time your web requests so that you don\u2019t flood a server with traffic.\nSource Code:Click here to download the free source codethat you\u2019ll use to collect and parse data from the Web.\nFor more information on web scraping with Python, check out the following resources:\nNote:If you enjoyed what you learned in this sample fromPython Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3, then be sure to check outthe rest of the book.\nTake the Quiz:Test your knowledge with our interactive \u201cA Practical Introduction to Web Scraping in Python\u201d quiz.

The term\"scraping\"refers to obtaining the information from another source (webpages) and saving it into a local file. For example: Suppose you are working on a project called\"Phone comparing website,\"where you require the price of mobile phones, ratings, and model names to make comparisons between the different mobile phones. If you collect these details by checking various sites, it will take much time. In that case, web scrapping plays an important role where by writing a few lines of code you can get the desired results.\nWeb Scrapping extracts the data from websites in the unstructured format. It helps to collect these unstructured data and convert it in a structured form.\nStartups prefer web scrapping because it is a cheap and effective way to get a large amount of data without any partnership with the data selling company.\nHere the question ariseswhether the web scrapping is legal or not. The answer is that some sites allow it when used legally. Web scraping is just a tool you can use it in the right way or wrong way.\nWeb scrapping is illegal if someone tries to scrap the nonpublic data. Nonpublic data is not reachable to everyone; if you try to extract such data then it is a violation of the legal term.\nThere are several tools available to scrap data from websites, such as:\nAs we have discussed above, web scrapping is used to extract the data from websites. But we should know how to use that raw data. That raw data can be used in various fields. Let's have a look at the usage of web scrapping:\nIt is widely used to collect data from several online shopping sites and compare the prices of products and make profitable pricing decisions. Price monitoring using web scrapped data gives the ability to the companies to know the market condition and facilitate dynamic pricing. It ensures the companies they always outrank others.\neb Scrapping is perfectly appropriate for market trend analysis. It is gaining insights into a particular market. The large organization requires a great deal of data, and web scrapping provides the data with a guaranteed level of reliability and accuracy.\nMany companies use personals e-mail data for email marketing. They can target the specific audience for their marketing.\nA single news cycle can create an outstanding effect or a genuine threat to your business. If your company depends on the news analysis of an organization, it frequently appears in the news. So web scraping provides the ultimate solution to monitoring and parsing the most critical stories. News articles and social media platform can directly influence the stock market.\nWeb Scrapping plays an essential role in extracting data from social media websites such asTwitter, Facebook,andInstagram,to find the trending topics.\nThe large set of data such asgeneral information, statistics, and temperatureis scrapped from websites, which is analyzed and used to carry out surveys or research and development.\nThere are other popular programming languages, but why we choose thePythonover other programming languages for web scraping? Below we are describing a list of Python's features that make the most useful programming language for web scrapping.\nIn Python, we don't need to define data types for variables; we can directly use the variable wherever it requires. It saves time and makes a task faster. Python defines its classes to identify the data type of variable.\nPython comes with an extensive range of libraries such asNumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scipy, etc., that provide flexibility to work with various purposes. It is suited for almost every emerging field and also for web scrapping for extracting data and do manipulation.\nThe purpose of the web scrapping is to save time. But what if you spend more time in writing the code? That's why we use Python, as it can perform a task in a few lines of code.\nPython is open-source, which means it is freely available for everyone. It has one of the biggest communities across the world where you can seek help if you get stuck anywhere in Python code.\nThe web scrapping consists of two parts:a web crawler and a web scraper. In simple words, the web crawler is a horse, and the scrapper is the chariot. The crawler leads the scrapper and extracts the requested data. Let's understand about these two components of web scrapping:\nA web crawler is generally called a\"spider.\"It is an artificial intelligence technology that browses the internet to index and searches for the content by given links. It searches for the relevant information asked by the programmer.\nA web scraper is a dedicated tool that is designed to extract the data from several websites quickly and effectively. Web scrappers vary widely in design and complexity, depending on the projects.\nThese are the following steps to perform web scraping. Let's understand the working of web scraping.\nStep -1: Find the URL that you want to scrape\nFirst, you should understand the requirement of data according to your project. A webpage or website contains a large amount of information. That's why scrap only relevant information. In simple words, the developer should be familiar with the data requirement.\nStep - 2: Inspecting the Page\nThe data is extracted in rawHTMLformat, which must be carefully parsed and reduce the noise from the raw data. In some cases, data can be simple as name and address or as complex as high dimensional weather and stock market data.\nStep - 3: Write the code\nWrite a code to extract the information, provide relevant information, and run the code.\nStep - 4: Store the data in the file\nStore that information in required csv,xml,JSONfile format.\nPython has a vast collection of libraries and also provides a very useful library for web scrapping. Let's understand the required library for Python.\nLibrary used for web scrapping\nPandas library is used fordata manipulation and analysis. It is used to extract the data and store it in the desired format.\n\nLet's understand theBeautifulSouplibrary in detail.\nInstallation of BeautifulSoup\nYou can install BeautifulSoup by typing the following command:\nInstalling a parser\nBeautifulSoup supports HTML parser and several third-party Python parsers. You can install any of them according to your dependency. The list of BeautifulSoup's parsers is the following:\nWe recommend you to installhtml5libparser because it is much suitable for the newer version of Python, or you can installlxmlparser.\nType the following command in your terminal:\nBeautifulSoup is used to transform a complex HTML document into a complex tree of Python objects. But there are a few essential types object which are mostly used:\nATagobject corresponds to an XML or HTML original document.\nOutput:\nTag contains lot of attributes and methods, but most important features of a tag are name and attribute.\nEvery tag has a name, accessible as.name:\nA tag may have any number of attributes. The tag <b id = \"boldest\"> has an attribute \"id\" whose value is \"boldest\". We can access a tag's attributes by treating the tag as dictionary.\nWe can add, remove, and modify a tag's attributes. It can be done by using tag as dictionary.\nIn HTML5, there are some attributes that can have multiple values. The class (consists more than one css) is the most common multivalued attributes. Other attributes arerel, rev, accept-charset, headers,andaccesskey.\nA string in BeautifulSoup refers text within a tag. BeautifulSoup uses theNavigableStringclass to contain these bits of text.\nA string is immutable means it can't be edited. But it can be replaced with another string usingreplace_with().\nIn some cases, if you want to use aNavigableStringoutside the BeautifulSoup, theunicode()helps it to turn into normal Python Unicode string.\nThe BeautifulSoup object represents the complete parsed document as a whole. In many cases, we can use it as a Tag object. It means it supports most of the methods described in navigating the tree and searching the tree.\nOutput:\nLet's take an example to understand the scrapping practically by extracting the data from the webpage and inspecting the whole page.\nFirst, open your favorite page on Wikipedia and inspect the whole page, and before extracting data from the webpage, you should ensure your requirement. Consider the following code:\nOutput:\nIn the following lines of code, we are extracting all headings of a webpage by class name. Here front-end knowledge plays an essential role in inspecting the webpage.\nOutput:\nIn the above code, we imported thebs4andrequestedthe library. In the third line, we created aresobject to send a request to the webpage. As you can observe that we have extracted all heading from the webpage.\nWebpage of Wikipedia Learning\nLet's understand another example; we will make a GET request to the URL and create a parse Tree object (soup) with the use of BeautifulSoup and Python built-in\"html5lib\"parser.\nHere we will scrap the webpage of given link(https://www.javatpoint.com/).Consider the following code:\nThe above code will display the all html code of javatpoint homepage.\nUsing theBeautifulSoupobject, i.e.soup, we can collect the required data table. Let's print some interesting information using thesoupobject:\nOutput:It will give an output as follow:\nOutput:It will give an output as follow:\nOutput:It will print all links along with its attributes. Here we display a few of them:\nIn this example, we will scrap the mobile phone prices, ratings, and model name from Flipkart, which is one of the popular e-commerce websites. Following are the prerequisites to accomplish this task:\nPrerequisites:\nStep - 1: Find the desired URL to scrap\nThe initial step is to find the URL that you want to scrap. Here we are extracting mobile phone details from the flipkart. The URL of this page is https://www.flipkart.com/search?q=iphones&otracker=search&otracker1=search&marketplace=FLIPKART&as-show=on&as=off.\nStep -2: Inspecting the page\nIt is necessary to inspect the page carefully because the data is usually contained within the tags. So we need to inspect to select the desired tag. To inspect the page, right-click on the element and click\"inspect\".\nStep - 3: Find the data for extracting\nExtract the Price, Name, and Rating, which are contained in the \"div\" tag, respectively.\nStep - 4: Write the Code\nOutput:\nWe scrapped the details of the iPhone and saved those details in the CSV file as you can see in the output. In the above code, we put a comment on the few lines of code for testing purpose. You can remove those comments and observe the output.\nIn this tutorial, we have discussed all basic concepts of web scrapping and described the sample scrapping from the leading online ecommerce site flipkart.\nWe provides tutorials and interview questions of all technology like java tutorial, android, java frameworks\nG-13, 2nd Floor, Sec-3, Noida, UP, 201301, India\n[email\u00a0protected].\nLatest Post\nPRIVACY POLICY", "https://www.javatpoint.com/python-tutorial": "Python\nAI, ML and Data Science\nJava\nB.Tech and MCA\nWeb Technology\nSoftware Testing\nTechnical Interview\nJava Interview\nWeb Interview\nDatabase Interview\nCompany Interviews\nOnline Compilers\nPython Tutorial\nPython OOPs\nPython MySQL\nPython MongoDB\nPython SQLite\nPython Questions\nPlotly\nPython Tkinter (GUI)\nPython Web Blocker\nPython MCQ\nRelated Tutorials\nPython Programs\nPython String functions\nPython Functions\nMisc\nPython Dictionary\nPython List\nPython Tutorial | Python Programming Language\nWhat is Python\nFeatures of Python:\nJava vs. Python\nPrinting 'Hello World'\nPython Basic Syntax\nHistory of Python\nWhy learn Python?\nWhere is Python used?\nPython Popular Frameworks and Libraries\nPython print() Function\nPython Conditional Statements\nPython Loops\nPythonFor Loop\nPythonWhile Loop\nPython Data Structures\n1.Lists\n2.Tuples\n3.Sets\n4.Dictionaries\nPython Functional Programming\nPython Function\nPython Modules\nPython File I/O\nPython Exceptions\nPython CSV\nPython Sending Mail\nPython Magic Methods\nPython Oops Concepts\nPython Advance Topics\nPython Iterator\nPython Generators\nPython Modifiers\nPython MySQL\nPython MongoDB\nPython SQLite\nPython CGI\nAsynchronous Programming in Python\nPython Concurrency\nWeb Scrapping using Python\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) using Python\nConclusion:\nPrerequisite\nAudience\nProblem\nLearn Important Tutorial\nB.Tech / MCA\nPreparation\nContact info\nFollow us\nTutorials\nInterview Questions\nOnline Compiler\nPythonis a widely used programming language that offers several unique features and advantages compared to languages likeJavaandC++.Our Python tutorial thoroughly explains Python basics and advanced concepts, starting withinstallation,conditional statements,loops,built-in data structures,Object-Oriented Programming,Generators,Exception Handling,Python RegEx, and many other concepts. This tutorial is designed for beginners and working professionals.\nIn the late 1980s,Guido van Rossumdreamed of developing Python. The first version ofPython 0.9.0 was released in 1991. Since its release, Python started gaining popularity. According to reports, Python is now the most popular programming language among developers because of its high demands in the tech realm.\nPython is a general-purpose, dynamically typed, high-level, compiled and interpreted, garbage-collected, and purely object-oriented programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\nPython has manyweb-based assets,open-source projects, anda vibrant community. Learning the language, working together on projects, and contributing to the Python ecosystem are all made very easy for developers.\nBecause of its straightforward language framework, Python is easier to understand and write code in. This makes it a fantastic programming language for novices. Additionally, it assists seasoned programmers in writing clear and error-free code.\nPython has many third-party libraries that can be used to make its functionality easier. These libraries cover many domains, for example, web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and more.\nPython is an excellent choice for rapid development and scripting tasks. Whereas Java emphasizes a strong type system and object-oriented programming.\nHere are some basic programs that illustrates key differences between them.\nPython Code:\nOutput:\nIn Python, it is one line of code. It requires simple syntax to print 'Hello World'\nJava Code:\nOutput:\nIn Java, we need to declare classes, method structures many other things.\nWhile both programs give the same output, we can notice the syntax difference in the print statement.\nThere is no use of curly braces or semicolons in Python programming language. It is an English-like language. But Python uses indentation to define a block of code. Indentation is nothing but adding whitespace before the statement when it is needed.\nFor example -\nIn the above example, the statements that are the same level to the right belong to the function. Generally, we can use four whitespaces to define indentation.\nInstead of Semicolon as used in other languages, Python ends its statements with a NewLine character.\nPython is a case-sensitive language, which means that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently. For example, 'name' and 'Name' are two different variables in Python.\nIn Python, comments can be added using the '#' symbol. Any text written after the '#' symbol is considered a comment and is ignored by the interpreter. This trick is useful for adding notes to the code or temporarily disabling a code block. It also helps in understanding the code better by some other developers.\n'If', 'otherwise','for','while', 'try', 'except', and 'finally' are a few reserved keywords in Python that cannot be used as variable names. These terms are used in the language for particular reasons and have fixed meanings. If you use these keywords, your code may include errors, or the interpreter may reject them as potential new Variables.\nPython was created by Guido van Rossum. In the late 1980s, Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, began working on Python while at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. He wanted to create a successor to theABC programming languagethat would be easy to read and efficient.\nIn February 1991, the first public version of Python, version 0.9.0, was released.This marked the official birth ofPython as an open-source project. The language was named after the British comedy series \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\".\nPython development has gone through several stages.In January 1994, Python 1.0 was released as a usable and stable programming language.This version included many of the features that are still present in Python today.\nFrom the 1990s to the 2000s, Python gained popularity for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.In October 2000, Python 2.0 was released. Python 2.0 introducedlist comprehensions,garbage collection, andsupport for Unicode.\nIn December 2008, Python 3.0 was released. Python 3.0 introduced several backward-incompatible changes to improve code readability and maintainability.\nThroughout 2010s, Python's popularity increased, particularly in fields likedata science,machine learning, andweb development. Its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks made it a favourite among developers.\nThePython Software Foundation (PSF) was established in 2001to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language and its community.\nPython provides many useful features to the programmer. These features make it the most popular and widely used language. We have listed below few-essential features of Python.\nPython is a general-purpose, popular programming language, and it is used in almost every technical field. The various areas of Python use are given below.\nPython has wide range of libraries and frameworks widely used in various fields such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, web applications, etc. We define some popular frameworks and libraries of Python as follows.\nPython print() function is used to display output to the console or terminal. It allows us to display text, variables and other data in a human readable format.\nSyntax:\nprint(object(s), sep=separator, end=end, file=file, flush=flush)\nIt takes one or more arguments separated by comma(,) and adds a 'newline' at the end by default.\nParameters:\nExample:\nOutput:\nIn this example, the print statement is used to print string, integer, and float values in a human readable format.\nThe print statement can be used for debugging, logging and to provide information to the user.\nConditional statements help us to execute a particular block for a particular condition. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use conditional expression to execute a different block of statements. Python provides if and else keywords to set up logical conditions. Theelifkeyword is also used as a conditional statement.\nExample code for if..else statement\nOutput:\nIn the above code, we have two variables, x, and y, with 10 and 5, respectively. Then we used an if..else statement to check if x is greater than y or vice versa. If the first condition is true, the statement \"x is greater than y\" is printed. If the first condition is false, the statement \"y is greater than or equal to x\" is printed instead.\nThe if keyword checks the condition is true and executes the code block inside it. The code inside the else block is executed if the condition is false. This way, the if..else statement helps us to execute different blocks of code based on a condition.\nWe will learn about this in more detail in the further article for the Python tutorial.\nSometimes we may need to alter the flow of the program. The execution of a specific code may need to be repeated several times. For this purpose, the programming languages provide various loops capable of repeating some specific code several times. Consider the following tutorial to understand the statements in detail.\nOutput:\nOutput:\nIn the above example code, we have demonstrated using two types of loops in Python - For loop and While loop.\nThe For loop is used to iterate over a sequence of items, such as a list, tuple, or string. In the example, we defined a list of fruits and used a for loop to print each fruit, but it can also be used to print a range of numbers.\nThe While loop repeats a code block if the specified condition is true. In the example, we have initialized a variable i to 1 and used a while loop to print the value of i until it becomes greater than or equal to 6. The i += 1 statement is used to increment the value of i in each iteration.\nWe will learn about them in the tutorial in detail.\nPython offers four built-in data structures:lists,tuples,sets, anddictionariesthat allow us to store data in an efficient way. Below are the commonly used data structures in Python, along with example code:\nExample:\nOutput:\nExample:\nOutput:\nExample:\nOutput:\nExample:\nOutput:\nThese are just a few examples of Python's built-in data structures. Each data structure has its own characteristics and use cases.\nThis section of the Python tutorial defines some important tools related to functional programming, such as lambda and recursive functions. These functions are very efficient in accomplishing complex tasks. We define a few important functions, such as reduce, map, and filter. Python provides the functools module that includes various functional programming tools. Visit the following tutorial to learn more about functional programming.\nRecent versions of Python have introduced features that make functional programming more concise and expressive. For example, the \"walrus operator\":= allows for inline variable assignment in expressions, which can be useful when working with nested function calls or list comprehensions.\nPython modulesare the program files that contain Python code or functions. Python has two types of modules - User-defined modules and built-in modules. A module the user defines, or our Python code saved with .py extension, is treated as a user-define module.\nBuilt-in modules are predefined modules of Python. To use the functionality of the modules, we need to import them into our current working program.\nPython modules are essential to the language's ecosystem since they offer reusable code and functionality that can be imported into any Python program. Here are a few examples of several Python modules, along with a brief description of each:\nMath: Gives users access to mathematical constants and pi and trigonometric functions.\nDatetime: Provides classes for a simpler way of manipulating dates, times, and periods.\nOS: Enables interaction with the base operating system, including administration of processes and file system activities.\nRandom: The random function offers tools for generating random integers and picking random items from a list.\nJSON: JSON is a data structure that can be encoded and decoded and is frequently used in online APIs and data exchange. This module allows dealing with JSON.Re: Supports regular expressions, a potent text-search and text-manipulation tool.\nCollections: Provides alternative data structures such as sorted dictionaries, default dictionaries, and named tuples.\nNumPy: NumPy is a core toolkit for scientific computing that supports numerical operations on arrays and matrices.\nPandas: It provides high-level data structures and operations for dealing with time series and other structured data types.\nRequests: Offers a simple user interface for web APIs and performs HTTP requests.\nFiles are used to store data in a computer disk. In this tutorial, we explain the built-in file object of Python. We can open a file using Python script and perform various operations such as writing, reading, and appending. There are various ways of opening a file. We are explained with the relevant example. We will also learn to perform read/write operations on binary files.\nPython's file input/output (I/O) systemoffers programs to communicate with files stored on a disc. Python's built-in methods for the file object let us carry out actions like reading, writing, and adding data to files.\nTheopen()method in Python makes a file object when working with files. The name of the file to be opened and the mode in which the file is to be opened are the two parameters required by this function. The mode can be used according to work that needs to be done with the file, such as \"r\" for reading, \"w\" for writing, or \"a\" for attaching.\nAfter successfully creating an object, different methods can be used according to our work. If we want to write in the file, we can use the write() functions, and if you want to read and write both, then we can use the append() function and, in cases where we only want to read the content of the file we can use read() function. Binary files containing data in a binary rather than a text format may also be worked with using Python. Binary files are written in a manner that humans cannot directly understand. Therbandwbmodes can read and write binary data in binary files.\nAn exception can be defined as an unusual condition in a program resulting in an interruption in the flow of the program.\nWhenever an exception occurs, the program stops the execution, and thus the other code is not executed. Therefore, an exception is the run-time errors that are unable to handle to Python script. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.\nPython Exceptionsare an important aspect of error handling in Python programming. When a program encounters an unexpected situation or error, it may raise an exception, which can interrupt the normal flow of the program.\nIn Python, exceptions are represented as objects containing information about the error, including its type and message. The most common type of Exception in Python is the Exception class, a base class for all other built-in exceptions.\nTo handle exceptions in Python, we use thetryandexceptstatements. Thetrystatement is used to enclose the code that may raise an exception, while theexceptstatement is used to define a block of code that should be executed when an exception occurs.\nFor example, consider the following code:\nOutput:\nIn this code, we use the try statement to attempt to perform a division operation. If either of these operations raises an exception, the matching except block is executed.\nPython also provides many built-in exceptions that can be raised in similar situations. Some common built-in exceptions includeIndexError, TypeError, andNameError. Also, we can define our custom exceptions by creating a new class that inherits from the Exception class.\nA CSV stands for \"comma separated values\", which is defined as a simple file format that uses specific structuring to arrange tabular data. It stores tabular data such as spreadsheets or databases in plain text and has a common format for data interchange. A CSV file opens into the Excel sheet, and the rows and columns data define the standard format.\nWe can use theCSV.readerfunction to read a CSV file. This function returns a reader object that we can use to repeat over the rows in the CSV file. Each row is returned as a list of values, where each value corresponds to a column in the CSV file.\nFor example, consider the following code:\nHere, we open the file data.csv in read mode and create acsv.readerobject using thecsv.reader()function. We then iterate over the rows in the CSV file using a for loop and print each row to the console.\nWe can use theCSV.writer()function to write data to a CSV file. It returns a writer object we can use to write rows to the CSV file. We can write rows by calling thewriter ()method on the writer object.\nFor example, consider the following code:\nIn this program, we create a list of lists called data, where each inner list represents a row of data. We then open the file data.csv in write mode and create aCSV.writerobject using the CSV.writer function. We then iterate over the rows in data using a for loop and write each row to the CSV file using the writer method.\nWe can send or read a mail using the Python script. Python's standard library modules are useful for handling various protocols such asPoP3andIMAP. Python provides thesmtplibmodule for sending emails using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). We will learn how to send mail with the popular email service SMTP from a Python script.\nThe Python magic method is the special method that adds \"magic\" to a class. It starts and ends with double underscores, for example,_init_or_str_.\nThe built-in classes define many magic methods. Thedir()function can be used to see the number of magic methods inherited by a class. It has two prefixes and suffix underscores in the method name.\nFor example, thestrmagic method can define how an object should be represented as a string. Here's an example\nOutput:\nIn this example, the str method is defined to return a formatted string representation of the Person object with the person's name and age.\nAnother commonly used magic method iseq, which defines how objects should be compared for equality. Here's an example:\nOutput:\nIn this example, theeqmethod is defined to return True if two Point objects have the same x and y coordinates and False otherwise.\nEverything in Python is treated as an object, including integer values, floats, functions, classes, and none. Apart from that, Python supports all oriented concepts. Below is a brief introduction to the Oops concepts of Python.\nTo read the Oops concept in detail, visit the following resources.\nPython includes many advances and useful concepts that help the programmer solve complex tasks. These concepts are given below.\nAn iterator is simply an object that can be iterated upon. It returns one Object at a time. It can be implemented using the two special methods,__iter__()and __next__().\nIterators in Python are objects that allow iteration over a collection of data. They process each collection element individually without loading the entire collection into memory.\nFor example, let's create an iterator that returns the squares of numbers up to a given limit:\nOutput:\nIn this example, we have created a class Squares that acts as an iterator by implementing the __iter__() and __next__() methods. The __iter__() method returns the Object itself, and the __next__() method returns the next square of the number until the limit is reached.\nTo learn more about the iterators, visit ourPython Iteratorstutorial.\nPython generatorsproduce a sequence of valuesusing a yield statementrather than a return since they are functions that return iterators. Generators terminate the function's execution while keeping the local state. It picks up right where it left off when it is restarted. Because we don't have to implement the iterator protocol thanks to this feature, writing iterators is made simpler. Here is an illustration of a straightforward generator function that produces squares of numbers:\nOutput:\nPython Decoratorsare functions used to modify the behaviour of another function. They allow adding functionality to an existing function without modifying its code directly. Decorators are defined using the@symbol followed by the name of the decorator function. They can be used for logging, timing, caching, etc.\nHere's an example of a decorator function that adds timing functionality to another function:\nOutput:\nIn the above example, the time_it decorator function takes another function as an argument and returns a wrapper function. The wrapper function calculates the time to execute the original function and prints it to the console. The @time_it decorator is used to apply the time_it function to the my_function function. When my_function is called, the decorator is executed, and the timing functionality is added.\nPython MySQL is a powerful relational database management system. We must set up the environment and establish a connection to use MySQL with Python. We can create a new database and tables using SQL commands in Python.\nOther relative points include handling errors, creating indexes, and using stored procedures and functions in MySQL with Python.\nPython MongoDBis a popular NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It is schemaless and provides high scalability and flexibility for data storage. We can use MongoDB with Python using the PyMongo library, which provides a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with MongoDB.\nHere are some common tasks when working with MongoDB in Python:\nThere are many more advanced topics in MongoDB, such as data sharding, replication, and more, but these tasks cover the basics of working with MongoDB in Python.\nRelational databases are built and maintained using Python SQLite, a compact, serverless, self-contained database engine. Its mobility and simplicity make it a popular option for local or small-scale applications. Python has a built-in module for connecting to SQLite databases called SQLite3, enabling developers to work with SQLite databases without difficulties.\nVarious API methods are available through the SQLite3 library that may be used to run SQL queries,insert,select,update, andremovedata, as well as get data from tables. Additionally, it allows transactions, allowing programmers to undo changes in case of a problem. Python SQLite is a fantastic option for creating programs that need an embedded database system, including desktop, mobile, and modest-sized web programs. SQLite has become popular among developers for lightweight apps with database functionality thanks to its ease of use, portability, and smooth connection with Python.\nPython CGIis a technology for running scripts through web servers to produce dynamic online content. It offers a communication channel and a dynamic content generation interface for external CGI scripts and the web server. Python CGI scripts may create HTML web pages, handle form input, and communicate with databases. Python CGI enables the server to carry out Python scripts and provide the results to the client, offering a quick and effective approach to creating dynamic online applications.\nPython CGI scripts may be used for many things, including creating dynamic web pages, processing forms, and interacting with databases. Since Python, a potent and popular programming language, can be utilized to create scripts, it enables a more customized and flexible approach to web creation. Scalable, safe, and maintainable online applications may be created with Python CGI. Python CGI is a handy tool for web developers building dynamic and interactive online applications.\nAsynchronous programmingis a paradigm for computer programming that enables independent and concurrent operation of activities. It is frequently used in applications like web servers, database software, and network programming, where several tasks or requests must be handled concurrently.\nPython has asyncio, Twisted, and Tornado among its libraries and frameworks for asynchronous programming. Asyncio, one of these, offers a simple interface for asynchronous programming and is the official asynchronous programming library in Python.\nCoroutines are functions that may be halted and restarted at specific locations in the code and are utilized by asyncio. This enables numerous coroutines to operate simultaneously without interfering with one another. For constructing and maintaining coroutines, the library offers several classes and methods, includingasyncio.gather(),asyncio.wait(),andasyncio.create_task().\nEvent loops, which are in charge of planning and operating coroutines, are another feature of asyncio. By cycling between coroutines in a non-blocking way, the event loop controls the execution of coroutines and ensures that no coroutine blocks another. Additionally, it supports timers and scheduling callbacks, which may be helpful when activities must be completed at specified times or intervals.\nThe term \"concurrency\" describes a program's capacity to carry out several tasks at once, enhancing the program's efficiency. Python offers several modules and concurrency-related methods, including asynchronous programming, multiprocessing, and multithreading. While multiprocessing involves running many processes simultaneously on a system, multithreading involves running numerous threads concurrently inside a single process.\nThethreading modulein Python enables programmers to build multithreading. It offers classes and operations for establishing and controlling threads. Conversely, the multiprocessing module allows developers to design and control processes. Python's asyncio module provides asynchronous programming support, allowing developers to write non-blocking code that can handle multiple tasks concurrently. Using these techniques, developers can write highperformance, scalable programs that can handle multiple tasks concurrently.\nPython's threading module enables the concurrent execution of several threads within a single process, which is helpful for I/O-bound activities.\nFor CPU-intensive operations like image processing or data analysis, multiprocessing modules make it possible to execute numerous processes concurrently across multiple CPU cores.\nThe asyncio module supports asynchronous I/O and permits the creation of single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines for high-concurrency network applications.\nWith libraries likeDask,PySpark, and MPI, Python may also be used for parallel computing. These libraries allow workloads to be distributed across numerous nodes or clusters for better performance.\nThe process of web scraping is used to retrieve data from websites automatically. Various tools and libraries extract data from HTML and other online formats. Python is among the most widely used programming languages for web scraping because of its ease of use, adaptability, and variety of libraries.\nWe must take a few steps to accomplish web scraping using Python. We must first decide which website to scrape and what information to gather. Then, we can submit a request to the website and receive the HTML content using Python's requests package. Once we have the HTML text, we can extract the needed data using a variety of parsing packages, likeBeautiful Soup and lxml.\nWe can employ several strategies, like slowing requests, employing user agents, and using proxies, to prevent overburdening the website's server. It is also crucial to abide by the terms of service for the website and respect its robots.txt file.\nData mining, lead creation, pricing tracking, and many more uses are possible for web scraping. However, as unauthorized web scraping may be against the law and unethical, it is essential to utilize it professionally and ethically.\nA branch of artificial intelligence (AI) called \"natural language processing\" (NLP) studies how computers and human language interact. Thanks to NLP, computers can now understand, interpret, and produce human language. Due to its simplicity, versatility, and strong libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and spaCy, Python is a well-known programming language for NLP.\nFor NLP tasks, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity identification, sentiment analysis, and others, NLTK provides a complete library.It has a variety of corpora (big, organized text collections) for developing and evaluating NLP models. Another well-liked library for NLP tasks isspaCy, which offers quick and effective processing of enormous amounts of text. It enables simple modification and expansion and comes with pre-trained models for various NLP workloads.\nNLP may be used in Python for various practical purposes, including chatbots, sentiment analysis, text categorization, machine translation, and more. NLP is used, for instance, by chatbots to comprehend and reply to user inquiries in a natural language style. Sentiment analysis, which may be helpful for brand monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and other purposes, employs NLP to categorize text sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).

While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. In the 20th century,industrial agriculturebased on large-scalemonoculturescame to dominate agricultural output.\nAs of 2021[update],small farmsproduce about one-third of the world's food, but large farms are prevalent.[2]The largest 1% of farms in the world are greater than 50 hectares (120 acres) and operate more than 70% of the world's farmland.[2]Nearly 40% of agricultural land is found on farms larger than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres).[2]However, five of every six farms in the world consist of fewer than 2 hectares (4.9 acres), and take up only around 12% of all agricultural land.[2]Farms and farming greatly influencerural economicsand greatly shaperural society, affecting both the directagricultural workforceand broaderbusinessesthat support the farms and farming populations.\nThe major agricultural products can be broadly grouped intofoods,fibers,fuels, andraw materials(such asrubber). Food classes includecereals(grains),vegetables,fruits,cooking oils,meat,milk,eggs, andfungi. Global agricultural production amounts to approximately 11 billion tonnes of food,[3]32 million tonnes of natural fibers[4]and 4 billion m3of wood.[5]However, around 14% of the world's food is lost from production before reaching the retail level.[6]\nModernagronomy,plant breeding,agrochemicalssuch aspesticidesandfertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increasedcrop yields, but also contributed toecological and environmental damage.Selective breedingand modern practices inanimal husbandryhave similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns aboutanimal welfareand environmental damage. Environmental issues includecontributions to climate change, depletion ofaquifers,deforestation,antibiotic resistance, andother agricultural pollution. Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive toenvironmental degradation, such asbiodiversity loss,desertification,soil degradation, andclimate change, all of which can cause decreases in crop yield.Genetically modified organismsare widely used, althoughsome countries ban them.\n\nThe wordagricultureis a lateMiddle Englishadaptation of Latinagricult\u016bra, fromager'field' andcult\u016bra'cultivation' or 'growing'.[7]While agriculture usually refers to human activities, certain species ofant,[8][9]termiteandbeetlehave been cultivating crops for up to 60 million years.[10]Agriculture is defined with varying scopes, in its broadest sense using natural resources to \"produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services\".[11]Thus defined, it includesarable farming, horticulture,animal husbandryandforestry, but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded.[11]It may also be broadly decomposed intoplant agriculture, which concerns the cultivation of useful plants,[12]andanimal agriculture, the production of agricultural animals.[13]\nThe development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained byhunting and gathering.[16]Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe,[17]and included a diverse range oftaxa, in at least 11 separatecenters of origin.[14]Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago.[18]In the Paleolithic Levant, 23,000 years ago, cereals cultivation ofemmer,barley, andoatshas been observed near the sea of Galilee.[19][20]Rice wasdomesticated in Chinabetween 11,500 and 6,200 BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC,[21]followed bymung,soyandazukibeans. Sheep were domesticated inMesopotamiabetween 13,000 and 11,000 years ago.[22]Cattle were domesticated from the wildaurochsin the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago.[23]Pig productionemerged in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia,[24]wherewild boarwere first domesticated about 10,500 years ago.[25]In theAndesof South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans,coca,llamas,alpacas, andguinea pigs.Sugarcaneand someroot vegetableswere domesticated inNew Guineaaround 9,000 years ago.Sorghumwas domesticated in theSahelregion of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago,[26]and was independently domesticated in Eurasia.In Mesoamerica, wildteosintewas bred intomaize(corn) from 10,000 to 6,000 years ago.[27][28][29]Thehorsewasdomesticatedin theEurasian Steppesaround 3500 BC.[30]Scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition fromhunter-gathererto agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasingsedentism; examples are theNatufian culturein theLevant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated.[31][32][33]\nIn Eurasia, theSumeriansstarted to live in villages from about 8,000 BC, relying on theTigrisandEuphratesrivers and a canal system for irrigation. Ploughs appear inpictographsaround 3,000 BC; seed-ploughs around 2,300 BC. Farmers grew wheat, barley, vegetables such as lentils and onions, and fruits including dates, grapes, and figs.[36]Ancient Egyptian agriculturerelied on theNile Riverand its seasonal flooding. Farming started in the predynastic period at the end of thePaleolithic, after 10,000 BC. Staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley, alongside industrial crops such asflaxandpapyrus.[37][38]InIndia, wheat, barley andjujubewere domesticated by 9,000 BC, soon followed by sheep and goats.[39]Cattle, sheep and goats were domesticated inMehrgarhculture by 8,000\u20136,000 BC.[40][41][42]Cotton was cultivated by the 5th\u20134th millennium BC.[43]Archeological evidence indicates an animal-drawnploughfrom 2,500 BC in theIndus Valley civilization.[44]\nIn China, from the 5th century BC, there was a nationwidegranarysystem and widespreadsilk farming.[45]Water-powered grain mills were in use by the 1st century BC,[46]followed by irrigation.[47]By the late 2nd century,heavy ploughshad been developed with iron ploughshares andmouldboards.[48][49]These spread westwards across Eurasia.[50]Asian rice was domesticated 8,200\u201313,500 years ago \u2013 depending on themolecular clockestimate that is used[51]\u2013 on the Pearl River in southern China with a single genetic origin from the wild riceOryza rufipogon.[52]InGreeceandRome, the major cereals were wheat, emmer, and barley, alongside vegetables including peas, beans, and olives. Sheep and goats were kept mainly for dairy products.[53][54]\nIn the Americas, crops domesticated inMesoamerica(apart from teosinte) include squash, beans, andcacao.[55]Cocoa was domesticated by the Mayo Chinchipe of the upper Amazon around 3,000 BC.[56]Theturkeywas probably domesticated in Mexico or the American Southwest.[57]TheAztecsdeveloped irrigation systems, formedterracedhillsides, fertilized their soil, and developedchinampasor artificial islands. TheMayasused extensive canal and raised field systems to farm swampland from 400 BC.[58][59][60][61][62]In South America agriculture may have begun about 9000 BC with the domestication ofsquash(Cucurbita) and other plants.[63]Cocawas domesticated in the Andes, as were the peanut, tomato, tobacco, andpineapple.[55]Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC.[64]Animals includingllamas,alpacas, andguinea pigswere domesticated there.[65]InNorth America, the indigenous people of theEast domesticated cropssuch assunflower, tobacco,[66]squash andChenopodium.[67][68]Wild foods includingwild riceandmaple sugarwere harvested.[69]The domesticatedstrawberryis a hybrid of a Chilean and a North American species, developed by breeding in Europe and North America.[70]Theindigenous people of the Southwestand thePacific Northwestpracticedforest gardeningandfire-stick farming. Thenatives controlled fireon a regional scale to create a low-intensityfire ecologythatsustained a low-density agriculturein loose rotation; a sort of \"wild\"permaculture.[71][72][73][74]A system ofcompanion plantingcalledthe Three Sisterswas developed in North America. The three crops werewinter squash, maize, and climbing beans.[75][76]\nIndigenous Australians, long supposed to have been nomadichunter-gatherers, practiced systematic burning, possibly to enhance natural productivity in fire-stick farming.[77]Scholars have pointed out that hunter-gatherers need a productive environment to support gathering without cultivation. Because the forests of New Guinea have few food plants, early humans may have used \"selective burning\" to increase the productivity of the wildkarukafruit trees to support the hunter-gatherer way of life.[78]\nTheGunditjmaraand other groups developedeelfarming and fish trapping systems from some 5,000 years ago.[79]There is evidence of 'intensification' across the whole continent over that period.[80]In two regions of Australia, the central west coast and eastern central, early farmers cultivated yams, native millet, and bush onions, possibly in permanent settlements.[33][81]\nIn theMiddle Ages, compared to theRoman period, agriculture in Western Europe became more focused onself-sufficiency. The agricultural population under feudalism was typically organized intomanorsconsisting of several hundred or more acres of land presided over by alord of the manorwith aRoman Catholicchurch and priest.[82]\nThanks to the exchange with theAl-Andaluswhere theArab Agricultural Revolutionwas underway, European agriculture transformed, with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees (such as the orange).[83]\nAfter 1492, theColumbian exchangebrought New World crops such as maize, potatoes, tomatoes,sweet potatoes, andmaniocto Europe, and Old World crops such as wheat, barley, rice, andturnips, and livestock (including horses, cattle, sheep and goats) to the Americas.[84]\nIrrigation,crop rotation, andfertilizersadvanced from the 17th century with theBritish Agricultural Revolution, allowing global population to rise significantly. Since 1900, agriculture in developed nations, and to a lesser extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity asmechanizationreplaces human labor, and assisted bysynthetic fertilizers, pesticides, andselective breeding. TheHaber-Boschmethod allowed the synthesis ofammonium nitratefertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasingcrop yieldsand sustaining a further increase in global population.[85][86]\nModern agriculture has raised or encountered ecological, political, and economic issues includingwater pollution,biofuels,genetically modified organisms,tariffsandfarm subsidies, leading to alternative approaches such as theorganic movement.[87][88]Unsustainable farming practices in North America led to theDust Bowlof the 1930s.[89]\nPastoralisminvolves managing domesticated animals. Innomadic pastoralism, herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture, fodder, and water. This type of farming is practiced in arid and semi-arid regions ofSahara, Central Asia and some parts of India.[90]\nInshifting cultivation, a small area of forest is cleared by cutting and burning the trees. The cleared land is used for growing crops for a few years until the soil becomes too infertile, and the area is abandoned. Another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated. This type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly. This practice is used in Northeast India, Southeast Asia, and the Amazon Basin.[91]\nSubsistence farmingis practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone, with little left over for transport elsewhere. It is intensively practiced in Monsoon Asia and South-East Asia.[92]An estimated 2.5\u00a0billion subsistence farmers worked in 2018, cultivating about 60% of the earth'sarable land.[93]\nIntensive farmingis cultivation to maximize productivity, with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs (water, fertilizer, pesticide and automation). It is practiced mainly in developed countries.[94][95]\nFrom the twentieth century onwards, intensive agriculture increased crop productivity. It substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, but caused increased water pollution, and often involved farm subsidies.Soil degradationand diseases such asstem rustare major concerns globally;[96]approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.[97][98]In recent years there has been a backlash against theenvironmental effectsof conventional agriculture, resulting in theorganic,regenerative, andsustainable agriculturemovements.[87][99]One of the major forces behind this movement has been theEuropean Union, which first certifiedorganic foodin 1991 and began reform of itsCommon Agricultural Policy(CAP) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies,[100]also known asdecoupling. The growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such asintegrated pest management, selective breeding,[101]andcontrolled-environment agriculture.[102][103]There are concerns about the lower yield associated withorganic farmingand its impact on globalfood security.[104]Recent mainstream technological developments includegenetically modified food.[105]\nBy 2015, the agricultural output of China was the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States.[106]Economists measure thetotal factor productivityof agriculture, according to which agriculture in the United States is roughly 1.7 times more productive than it was in 1948.[107]\nAgriculture employed 873 million people in 2021, or 27% of the global workforce, compared with 1 027 million (or 40%) in 2000. The share of agriculture in global GDP was stable at around 4% since 2000\u20132023.[108]\nDespite increases in agricultural production and productivity,[109]between 702 and 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021.[110]Food insecurity and malnutrition can be the result of conflict, climate extremes and variability and economic swings.[109]It can also be caused by a country's structural characteristics such as income status and natural resource endowments as well as its political economy.[109]\nPesticide use in agriculture went up 62% between 2000 and 2021, with the Americas accounting for half the use in 2021.[108]\nTheInternational Fund for Agricultural Developmentposits that an increase insmallholder agriculturemay be part of the solution to concerns aboutfood pricesand overallfood security, given the favorable experience of Vietnam.[111]\nAgriculture provides about one-quarter of all global employment, more than half in sub-Saharan Africa and almost 60 percent in low-income countries.[112]As countries develop, other jobs have historically pulled workers away from agriculture, and labor-saving innovations increase agricultural productivity by reducing labor requirements per unit of output.[113][114][115]Over time, a combination of labor supply and labor demand trends have driven down the share of population employed in agriculture.[116][117]\nDuring the 16th century in Europe, between 55 and 75% of the population was engaged in agriculture; by the 19th century, this had dropped to between 35 and 65%.[118]In the same countries today, the figure is less than 10%.[119]At the start of the 21st century, some one billion people, or over 1/3 of the available work force, were employed in agriculture. This constitutes approximately 70% of the global employment of children, and in many countries constitutes the largest percentage of women of any industry.[120]The service sector overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 2007.[121]\nIn many developed countries, immigrants help fill labor shortages in high-value agriculture activities that are difficult to mechanize.[122]Foreign farm workers from mostly Eastern Europe, North Africa and South Asia constituted around one-third of the salaried agricultural workforce in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal in 2013.[123][124][125][126]In the United States of America, more than half of all hired farmworkers (roughly 450,000 workers) were immigrants in 2019, although the number of new immigrants arriving in the country to work in agriculture has fallen by 75 percent in recent years and rising wages indicate this has led to a major labor shortage on U.S. farms.[127][128]\nAround the world, women make up a large share of the population employed in agriculture.[129]This share is growing in all developing regions except East and Southeast Asia where women already make up about 50 percent of the agricultural workforce.[129]Women make up 47 percent of the agricultural workforce in sub-Saharan Africa, a rate that has not changed significantly in the past few decades.[129]However, theFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations(FAO) posits that the roles and responsibilities of women in agriculture may be changing \u2013 for example, from subsistence farming to wage employment, and from contributing household members to primary producers in the context of male-out-migration.[129]\nIn general, women account for a greater share of agricultural employment at lower levels of economic development, as inadequate education, limited access to basic infrastructure and markets, high unpaid work burden and poor rural employment opportunities outside agriculture severely limit women's opportunities for off-farm work.[130]\nWomen who work in agricultural production tend to do so under highly unfavorable conditions. They tend to be concentrated in the poorest countries, where alternative livelihoods are not available, and they maintain the intensity of their work in conditions of climate-induced weather shocks and in situations of conflict. Women are less likely to participate as entrepreneurs and independent farmers and are engaged in the production of less lucrative crops.[130]\nThe gender gap in land productivity between female- and male managed farms of the same size is 24 percent. On average, women earn 18.4 percent less than men in wage employment in agriculture; this means that women receive 82 cents for every dollar earned by men. Progress has been slow in closing gaps in women's access to irrigation and in ownership of livestock, too.[130]\nWomen in agriculture still have significantly less access than men to inputs, including improved seeds, fertilizers and mechanized equipment. On a positive note, the gender gap in access to mobile internet in low- and middle-income countries fell from 25 percent to 16 percent between 2017 and 2021, and the gender gap in access to bank accounts narrowed from 9 to 6 percentage points. Women are as likely as men to adopt new technologies when the necessary enabling factors are put in place and they have equal access to complementary resources.[130]\nAgriculture, specifically farming, remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease,noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. Onindustrialized farms, injuries frequently involve the use ofagricultural machinery, and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries istractor rollovers.[131]Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can behazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects.[132]As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for injuries, illness, and death.[133]Ages 0\u20136 may be an especially vulnerable population in agriculture;[134]common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning, machinery and motor accidents, including with all-terrain vehicles.[133][134][135]\nTheInternational Labor Organizationconsiders agriculture \"one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors\".[120]It estimates that the annual work-related death toll among agricultural employees is at least 170,000, twice the average rate of other jobs. In addition, incidences of death, injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported.[136]The organization has developed theSafety and Health in Agriculture Convention, 2001, which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation, the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play.[120]\nIn the United States, agriculture has been identified by theNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Healthas a priority industry sector in theNational Occupational Research Agendato identify and provide intervention strategies for occupational health and safety issues.[137][138]In the European Union, theEuropean Agency for Safety and Health at Workhas issued guidelines on implementing health and safety directives in agriculture, livestock farming, horticulture, and forestry.[139]The Agricultural Safety and Health Council of America (ASHCA) also holds a yearly summit to discuss safety.[140]\nOverall production varies by country as listed.\nThe twenty largest countries by agricultural output (in nominal terms) at peak level as of 2018, according to theIMFandCIA World Factbook.\nCropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.[142][143]\nShifting cultivation (orslash and burn) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and thenperennialcrops for a period of several years.[144]Then the plot is leftfallowto regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10\u201320). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer ormanure) and some manualpest control. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.[144]\nFurther industrialization led to the use ofmonocultures, when onecultivaris planted on a large acreage. Because of the lowbiodiversity, nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use ofpesticidesand fertilizers.[143]Multiple cropping, in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, andintercropping, when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems known aspolycultures.[144]\nInsubtropicalandaridenvironments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multipleannual cropsin a year, or requiring irrigation. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such asagroforestry. Intemperateenvironments, where ecosystems were predominantlygrasslandorprairie, highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system.[144]\nImportant categories of food crops include cereals, legumes, forage, fruits and vegetables.[145]Natural fibersinclude cotton,wool,hemp, silk andflax.[146]Specific crops are cultivated in distinctgrowing regionsthroughout the world. Production is listed in millions of metric tons, based onFAOestimates.[145]\nAnimal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat, milk,eggs, orwool, and for work and transport.[147]Working animals, including horses,mules,oxen,water buffalo, camels, llamas, alpacas, donkeys, and dogs, have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields,harvestcrops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers.[148]\nLivestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as grassland-based, mixed, and landless.[149]As of 2010[update], 30% of Earth's ice- and water-free area was used for producing livestock, with the sector employing approximately 1.3\u00a0billion people. Between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050.[150]Aquacultureor fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.[151]\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestockbreedsandcrossbreedsthat increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preservegenetic diversity. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.[152]\nGrassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such asshrubland,rangeland, andpasturesfor feedingruminantanimals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30\u201340\u00a0million pastoralists.[144]Mixed production systems use grassland,foddercrops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.[149]\nLandless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently inOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Developmentmember countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure use becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.[149]Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be inconfined animal feeding operations, sometimes calledfactory farming. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa.[150]Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage ofgrowth hormones, are controversial.[153]\nTillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow orharrowto prepare for planting, for nutrient incorporation, or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional tono-till. It can improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO2, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.[154][155]\nPest control includes the management of weeds, insects,mites, and diseases. Chemical (pesticides), biological (biocontrol), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include crop rotation,culling,cover crops, intercropping,composting, avoidance, and resistance. Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.[156]\nNutrient managementincludes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of use of manure produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, manure,green manure, compost and minerals.[157]Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or afallowperiod. Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, orby spreadingeither dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland orpastures.[154][158]\nWater managementis needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.[144]Some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as theGreat Plainsin the U.S. and Canada, farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture for the following year.[159]Recent technological innovations in precision agriculture allow for water status monitoring and automate water usage, leading to more efficient management.[160]Agriculture represents 70% of freshwater use worldwide.[161]However, water withdrawal ratios for agriculture vary significantly by income level. In least developed countries and landlocked developing countries, water withdrawal ratios for agriculture are as high as 90 percent of total water withdrawals and about 60 percent inSmall Island Developing States.[162]\nAccording to 2014 report by theInternational Food Policy Research Institute, agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other. Using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, the International Food Policy Research Institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.[163]\nPayment for ecosystem servicesis a method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to conserve some aspects of the environment. Measures might include paying for reforestation upstream of a city, to improve the supply of fresh water.[164]\nDifferent definitions exist for agricultural automation and for the variety of tools and technologies that are used to automate production. One view is that agricultural automation refers to autonomous navigation by robots without human intervention.[165]Alternatively, it is defined as the accomplishment of production tasks through mobile, autonomous, decision-making, mechatronic devices.[166]However,FAOfinds that these definitions do not capture all the aspects and forms of automation, such as robotic milking machines that are static, most motorized machinery that automates the performing of agricultural operations, and digital tools (e.g., sensors) that automate only diagnosis.[160]FAO defines agricultural automation as the use of machinery and equipment in agricultural operations to improve their diagnosis, decision-making or performing, reducing the drudgery of agricultural work or improving the timeliness, and potentially the precision, of agricultural operations.[167]\nThe technological evolution in agriculture has involved a progressive move from manual tools to animal traction, to motorized mechanization, to digital equipment and finally, to robotics with artificial intelligence (AI).[167]Motorized mechanization using engine power automates the performance of agricultural operations such as ploughing and milking.[168]With digital automation technologies, it also becomes possible to automate diagnosis and decision-making of agricultural operations.[167]For example, autonomous crop robots can harvest and seed crops, while drones can gather information to help automate input application.[160]Precision agriculture often employs such automation technologies.[160]Motorized machines are increasingly complemented, or even superseded, by new digital equipment that automates diagnosis and decision-making.[168]A conventional tractor, for example, can be converted into an automated vehicle allowing it to sow a field autonomously.[168]\nMotorized mechanization has increased significantly across the world in recent years, although reliable global data with broad country coverage exist only for tractors and only up to 2009.[169]Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where the adoption of motorized mechanization has stalled over the past decades.[160][170]\nAutomation technologies are increasingly used for managing livestock, though evidence on adoption is lacking. Global automatic milking system sales have increased over recent years, but adoption is likely mostly in Northern Europe,[171]and likely almost absent in low- and middle-income countries. Automated feeding machines for both cows and poultry also exist, but data and evidence regarding their adoption trends and drivers is likewise scarce.[172][160]\nMeasuring the overall employment impacts of agricultural automation is difficult because it requires large amounts of data tracking all the transformations and the associated reallocation of workers both upstream and downstream.[167]While automation technologies reduce labor needs for the newly automated tasks, they also generate new labor demand for other tasks, such as equipment maintenance and operation.[160]Agricultural automation can also stimulate employment by allowing producers to expand production and by creating other agrifood systems jobs.[173]This is especially true when it happens in context of rising scarcity of rural labor, as is the case in high-income countries and many middle-income countries.[173]On the other hand, if forcedly promoted, for example through government subsidies in contexts of abundant rural labor, it can lead to labor displacement and falling or stagnant wages, particularly affecting poor and low-skilled workers.[173]\nClimate changeand agriculture are interrelated on a global scale.Climate change affects agriculturethrough changes inaverage temperatures, rainfall, andweather extremes(like storms and heat waves); changes in pests and diseases; changes in atmosphericcarbon dioxideand ground-levelozoneconcentrations; changes in the nutritional quality of some foods;[174]and changes insea level.[175]Global warming is already affecting agriculture, with effects unevenly distributed across the world.[176]\nIn a 2022 report, theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Changedescribes how human-induced warming has slowed growth of agricultural productivity over the past 50 years in mid and low latitudes.[177]Methane emissions have negatively impacted crop yields by increasing temperatures and surface ozone concentrations.[177]Warming is also negatively affecting crop and grassland quality and harvest stability.[177]Ocean warminghas decreased sustainable yields of some wild fish populations while ocean acidification and warming have already affected farmed aquatic species.[177]Climate change will probably increase the risk offood insecurityfor some vulnerable groups, such as thepoor.[178]\nCrop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticistGregor Mendel. His work ondominantandrecessive alleles, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits,self-pollinationandcross-pollination, and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.[179]\nDomestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance anddrought tolerance, eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.[180][181]\nTheGreen Revolutionpopularized the use of conventionalhybridizationto sharply increase yield by creating \"high-yielding varieties\". For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the US have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, and growth control to avoid lodging).[182][183][184]\nInvestments intoinnovationfor agriculture are long term. This is because it takes time for research to become commercialized and for technology to be adapted to meet multiple regions\u2019 needs, as well as meet national guidelines before being adopted and planted in a farmer's fields. For instance, it took at least 60 years from the introduction ofhybrid corntechnology before its adoption became widespread.[185][186]\nAgricultural innovation developed for the specific agroecological conditions of one region is not easily transferred and used in another region with different agroecological conditions. Instead, the innovation would have to be adapted to the specific conditions of that other region and respect itsbiodiversityand environmental requirements and guidelines. Some such adaptations can be seen through the steadily increasing number of plant varieties protected under the plant variety protection instrument administered by theInternational Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants(UPOV).[185]\nGenetically modified organisms (GMO) areorganismswhosegeneticmaterial has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known asrecombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to use in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering.[187]For some, GMO crops causefood safetyandfood labelingconcerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops.[188]TheBiosafety Protocol, an international treaty, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.[189]\nHerbicide-resistant seeds have a gene implanted into their genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, includingglyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide.[190]With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides.[191][192]Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.[193]\nOther GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacteriumBacillus thuringiensis(Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects.[194]Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes.[195]\n\nAgriculture is both a cause of and sensitive toenvironmental degradation, such asbiodiversity loss,desertification,soil degradationandclimate change, which cause decreases in crop yield.[196]Agriculture is one of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions. Agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment, including insecticides, especially those used on cotton.[197][198][page\u00a0needed]The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report stated that agricultural operations produced some 13 percent of anthropogenic global greenhouse gas emissions. This includes gases from the use of inorganic fertilizers, agro-chemical pesticides, and herbicides, as well as fossil fuel-energy inputs.[199]\nAgriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature (especially herbicides and insecticides), nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, and loss of natural environment. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of \u00a32,343\u00a0million, or \u00a3208 per hectare.[200]A 2005 analysis of these costs in the US concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to $16\u00a0billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714\u00a0million.[201]Both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs. Neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society.[200][201]\nAgriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs, often employing measures that cut biodiversity to very low levels. Yield increases with inputs such as fertilizers and removal of pathogens, predators, and competitors (such as weeds). Costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units, such as making fields larger; this means removinghedges, ditches and other areas of habitat. Pesticides kill insects, plants and fungi. Effective yields fall with on-farm losses, which may be caused by poor production practices during harvesting, handling, and storage.[202]\nThe environmental effects of climate change show that research on pests and diseases that do not generally afflict areas is essential. In 2021, farmers discoveredstem ruston wheat in theChampagnearea of France, a disease that had previously only occurred inMoroccofor 20 to 30 years. Because of climate change, insects that used to die off over the winter are now alive and multiplying.[203][204]\nA senior UN official, Henning Steinfeld, said that \"Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems\".[205]Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet. It is one of the largest sources ofgreenhouse gases, responsible for 18% of the world'sgreenhouse gas emissionsas measured in CO2equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO2. It produces 65% of human-relatednitrous oxide(which has 296 times theglobal warming potentialof CO2) and 37% of all human-inducedmethane(which is 23 times as warming as CO2.) It also generates 64% of theammoniaemission. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor drivingdeforestation; in the Amazon basin 70% ofpreviously forested areais now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feed crops.[206]Through deforestation andland degradation, livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity. A well documented phenomenon iswoody plant encroachment, caused byovergrazingin rangelands.[207]Furthermore, theUnited Nations Environment Programme(UNEP) states that \"methane emissionsfrom global livestock are projected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030 under current practices and consumption patterns.\"[199]\nLand transformation, the use of land to yield goods and services, is the most substantial way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is the driving force causingbiodiversity loss. Estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50%.[208]It is estimated that 24% of land globally experiences land degradation, a long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, with cropland being disproportionately affected.[209]Land management is the driving factor behind degradation; 1.5\u00a0billion people rely upon the degrading land. Degradation can be through deforestation,desertification,soil erosion, mineral depletion,acidification, orsalinization.[144]In 2021, the global agricultural land area was 4.79 billion hectares (ha), down 2 percent, or 0.09 billion ha compared with 2000. Between 2000 and 2021, roughly two-thirds of agricultural land were used for permanent meadows and pastures (3.21 billion ha in 2021), which declined by 5 percent (0.17 billion ha). One-third of the total agricultural land was cropland (1.58 billion ha in 2021), which increased by 6 percent (0.09 billion ha).[108]\nEutrophication, excessive nutrient enrichment inaquatic ecosystemsresulting inalgal bloomsandanoxia, leads tofish kills,loss of biodiversity, and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses. Excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland, as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainlynitrogenandphosphorus)runoffandleachingfrom agricultural land. These nutrients are majornonpoint pollutantscontributing toeutrophicationof aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater, with harmful effects on human populations.[210]Fertilizers also reduce terrestrial biodiversity by increasing competition for light, favoring those species that are able to benefit from the added nutrients.[211]\nAgriculture simultaneously is facing growing freshwater demand and precipitation anomalies (droughts, floods, and extreme rainfall and weather events) on rainfed areas fields and grazing lands.[162]Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources,[212][213]and an estimated 41 percent of current global irrigation water use occurs at the expense of environmental flow requirements.[162]It is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern China, theUpper Gangesand the western US are being depleted, and new research extends these problems to aquifers in Iran, Mexico and Saudi Arabia.[214]Increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas, meaning thatwater scarcityis increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world's growing population with reduced water resources.[215]While industrial withdrawals have declined in the past few decades and municipal withdrawals have increased only marginally since 2010, agricultural withdrawals have continued to grow at an ever faster pace.[162]Agricultural waterusage can also cause major environmental problems, including the destruction of natural wetlands, the spread of water-borne diseases, and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging, when irrigation is performed incorrectly.[216]\nPesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5\u00a0million short tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant.[217]The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually, causing 220,000 deaths.[218]Pesticides select forpesticide resistancein the pest population, leading to a condition termed the \"pesticide treadmill\" in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide.[219]\nAn alternative argument is that the way to \"save the environment\" and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'.[220][221]However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable,[222]and that pesticides can replacegood agronomic practicessuch as crop rotation.[219]ThePush\u2013pull agricultural pest managementtechnique involves intercropping, using plant aromas to repel pests from crops (push) and to lure them to a place from which they can then be removed (pull).[223]\nAgriculture contributes towardsclimate changethroughgreenhouse gas emissionsand by the conversion of non-agricultural land such asforestsinto agricultural land.[224]The agriculture, forestry and land use sector contribute between 13% and 21% of global greenhouse gas emissions.[225]Emissions ofnitrous oxide,methanemake up over half of total greenhouse gas emission from agriculture.[226]Animal husbandryis a major source of greenhouse gas emissions.[227]\nApproximately 57% of global GHG emissions from the production of food are from the production of animal-based food while plant-based foods contribute 29% and the remaining 14% is for other utilizations.[228]Farmland management andland-use changerepresented major shares of total emissions (38% and 29%, respectively), whereas rice and beef were the largest contributing plant- and animal-based commodities (12% and 25%, respectively).[228]South and Southeast Asia and South America were the largest emitters of production-based GHGs.[228]\nCurrent farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. There is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how water, land, andecosystemresources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. A solution would be to give value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests.[229]Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.[230]\nTechnological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable.[231]Technology permits innovations likeconservation tillage, a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, reduces water pollution, and enhancescarbon sequestration.[232]\nAgricultural automation can help address some of the challenges associated with climate change and thus facilitate adaptation efforts.[160]For example, the application of digital automation technologies (e.g. in precision agriculture) can improve resource-use efficiency in conditions which are increasingly constrained for agricultural producers.[160]Moreover, when applied to sensing and early warning, they can help address the uncertainty and unpredictability of weather conditions associated with accelerating climate change.[160]\nOther potential sustainable practices includeconservation agriculture,agroforestry, improvedgrazing, avoided grassland conversion, andbiochar.[233][234]Current mono-crop farming practices in the United States preclude widespread adoption of sustainable practices, such as 2\u20133 crop rotations that incorporate grass or hay with annual crops, unless negative emission goals such as soil carbon sequestration become policy.[235]\nThe food demand of Earth's projected population, with current climate change predictions, could be satisfied by improvement of agricultural methods, expansion of agricultural areas, and a sustainability-oriented consumer mindset.[236]\nSince the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes fromfossil fuelsources.[237]Between the 1960s and the 1980s, the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area)[238]asworld populationdoubled. Heavy reliance onpetrochemicalshas raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output.[239]\nIndustrialized agriculture depends onfossil fuelsin two fundamental ways: direct consumption on the farm and manufacture of inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery.[239]\nIndirect consumption includes the manufacture of fertilizers, pesticides, and farm machinery.[239]In particular, the production ofnitrogen fertilizercan account for over half of agricultural energy usage.[240]Together, direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2% of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has since gradually declined.[239]Food systemsencompass not just agriculture but off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.[241][242]\nPlastic products are used extensively in agriculture, including to increase crop yields and improve the efficiency of water and agrichemical use. \"Agriplastic\" products include films to covergreenhousesand tunnels, mulch to cover soil (e.g. to suppress weeds,conserve water, increase soil temperature and aid fertilizer application), shade cloth, pesticide containers, seedling trays, protective mesh and irrigation tubing. The polymers most commonly used in these products are low- density polyethylene (LPDE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).[243]\nThe total amount of plastics used in agriculture is difficult to quantify. A 2012 study reported that almost 6.5\u00a0million tonnes per year were consumed globally while a later study estimated that global demand in 2015 was between 7.3\u00a0million and 9 million tonnes. Widespread use of plastic mulch and lack of systematic collection and management have led to the generation of large amounts of mulch residue. Weathering and degradation eventually cause the mulch to fragment. These fragments and larger pieces of plastic accumulate in soil. Mulch residue has been measured at levels of 50 to 260\u00a0kg per hectare in topsoil in areas where mulch use dates back more than 10 years, which confirms that mulching is a major source of both microplastic and macroplasticsoil contamination.[243]\nAgricultural plastics, especially plastic films, are not easy to recycle because of high contamination levels (up to 40\u201350% by weight contamination by pesticides, fertilizers, soil and debris, moist vegetation, silage juice water, and UV stabilizers) and collection difficulties . Therefore, they are often buried or abandoned in fields and watercourses or burned. These disposal practices lead to soil degradation and can result in contamination of soils and leakage ofmicroplasticsinto the marine environment as a result of precipitation run-off and tidal washing. In addition, additives in residual plastic film (such as UV and thermal stabilizers) may have deleterious effects on crop growth, soil structure, nutrient transport and salt levels. There is a risk that plastic mulch will deterioratesoil quality, deplete soil organic matter stocks, increase soil water repellence and emit greenhouse gases. Microplastics released through fragmentation of agricultural plastics can absorb and concentrate contaminants capable of being passed up the trophic chain.[243]\nAgricultural economics is economics as it relates to the \"production, distribution and consumption of [agricultural] goods and services\".[245]Combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late 1800s, and grew significantly through the 20th century.[246]Although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent, major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history, ranging fromtenant farmersandsharecroppingin the post-American Civil WarSouthern United States[247]to the Europeanfeudalsystem ofmanorialism.[248]In the United States, and elsewhere, food costs attributed tofood processing, distribution, andagricultural marketing, sometimes referred to as thevalue chain, have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined. This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level ofvalue addition(e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain.Market concentrationhas increased in the sector as well, and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistributeeconomic surplusfrom producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.[249]\nNational government policies, such as taxation,subsidies, tariffs and others, can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products.[250]Since at least the 1960s, a combination of trade restrictions,exchange rate policiesand subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and the developed world. In the 1980s, non-subsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions.[251]\nHowever, as of 2009[update], there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the most trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among theoilseeds, sesame had the most taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have decreases more among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.[250]Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers.[252]Unprocessed commodities such as corn, soybeans, and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality, affecting the price the producer receives. Commodities are generally reported by production quantities, such as volume, number or weight.[253]\nAgricultural scienceis a broad multidisciplinary field ofbiologythat encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic andsocial sciencesused in the practice and understanding of agriculture. It covers topics such as agronomy, plant breeding and genetics,plant pathology, crop modeling, soil science,entomology, production techniques and improvement, study of pests and their management, and study of adverse environmental effects such as soil degradation,waste management, andbioremediation.[254][255]\nThe scientific study of agriculture began in the 18th century, whenJohann Friedrich Mayerconducted experiments on the use ofgypsum(hydratedcalcium sulphate) as a fertilizer.[256]Research became more systematic when in 1843,John Lawesand Henry Gilbert began a set of long-term agronomy field experiments atRothamsted Research Stationin England; some of them, such as thePark Grass Experiment, are still running.[257][258]In America, theHatch Act of 1887provided funding for what it was the first to call \"agricultural science\", driven by farmers' interest in fertilizers.[259]In agricultural entomology, the USDA began to research biological control in 1881; it instituted its first large program in 1905, searching Europe and Japan for natural enemies of thespongy mothandbrown-tailmoth, establishingparasitoids(such as solitary wasps) and predators of both pests in the US.[260][261][262]\nAgricultural policyis the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters),economic stability(including policies related to taxes), natural resources andenvironmental sustainability(especiallywater policy), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries).[264]Agricultural policy can also touch onfood quality, ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, andconservation. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.[265]\nA 2021 report finds that globally, support to agricultural producers accounts for almost US$540 billion a year.[266]This amounts to 15 percent of total agricultural production value, and is heavily biased towards measures that are leading to inefficiency, as well as are unequally distributed and harmful for the environment and human health.[266]\nThere are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers,agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. Agribusiness interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form oflobbyingandcampaign contributions. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities.[267]TheFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations(FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.[268]\nThis article incorporates text from afree contentwork.

Certified organic agriculture today accounts for 70\u00a0million hectares (170\u00a0million acres) globally, with over half of that total in Australia.[11]\nOrganic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or severely limiting synthetic substances.[12]For instance, naturally occurring pesticides such as garlic extract, bicarbonate of soda, orpyrethrin(which is found naturally in theChrysanthemumflower) are permitted, while syntheticfertilizersandpesticidessuch asglyphosateare prohibited. Synthetic substances that are allowed only in exceptional circumstances may includecopper sulfate, elementalsulfur, andveterinary drugs.Genetically modified organisms,nanomaterials, humansewage sludge,plant growth regulators,hormones, andantibiotic use in livestockhusbandry are prohibited.[13][14]Broadly, organic agriculture is based on the principles of health, care for all living beings and the environment, ecology, and fairness.[15]Organic methods championsustainability,[16][17]self-sufficiency,autonomyandindependence,[17]health, animal welfare,food security, andfood safety. It is often seen as part of the solution to the impacts ofclimate change.[18]\nOrganic agricultural methods are internationally regulated and legally enforced by transnational organizations such as theEuropean Unionand also by individual nations, based in large part on the standards set by theInternational Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements(IFOAM),[19]an internationalumbrella organizationfor organic farming organizations established in 1972, with regional branches such as IFOAM Organics Europe[20]and IFOAM Asia.[21]Since 1990, the market fororganic foodand other products has grown rapidly, reaching $150 billion worldwide in 2022 \u2013 of which more than $64 billion was earned in North America and EUR 53 billion in Europe.[22]This demand has driven a similar increase in organically managed farmland, which grew by 26.6 percent from 2021 to 2022.[23]As of 2022, organic farming is practiced in 188 countries and approximately 96,000,000 hectares (240,000,000 acres) worldwide were farmed organically by 4.5 million farmers, representing approximately 2 percent of total world farmland.[24]\nAgriculturewas practiced for thousands of years without the use of artificial chemicals.Artificial fertilizerswere first developed during the mid-19th century. Theseearly fertilizerswere cheap, powerful, and easy to transport in bulk. Similar advances occurred in chemicalpesticidesin the 1940s, leading to the decade being referred to as the \"pesticide era\".[25]These new agricultural techniques, while beneficial in the short-term, had serious longer-term side-effects such assoil compaction,erosion, and declines in overallsoil fertility, along with health concerns about toxic chemicals entering the food supply.[26]:\u200a10In the late 1800s and early 1900s,soil biologyscientists began to seek ways to remedy these side effects while still maintaining higher production.\nIn 1921 the founder and pioneer of the organic movementAlbert Howardand his wifeGabrielle Howard,[27][28][29]accomplishedbotanists, founded an Institute of Plant Industry to improve traditional farming methods in India. Among other things, they brought improved implements and improved animal husbandry methods from their scientific training; then by incorporating aspects of Indian traditional methods, developed protocols for the rotation of crops, erosion prevention techniques, and the systematic use of composts and manures.[30]Stimulated by these experiences of traditional farming, when Albert Howard returned to Britain in the early 1930s[31]he began to promulgate a system of organic agriculture.[32][33][34]\nIn 1924Rudolf Steinergave a series of eight lectures on agriculture with a focus on influences of the moon, planets, non-physical beings and elemental forces.[35][36]They were held in response to a request by adherent farmers who noticed degraded soil conditions and a deterioration in the health and quality of crops and livestock resulting from the use of chemical fertilizers.[37]The lectures were published in November 1924; the first English translation appeared in 1928 asThe Agriculture Course.[38]\nIn July 1939,Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, the author of the standard work onbiodynamic agriculture(Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening),[39]came to the UK at the invitation ofWalter James, 4th Baron Northbourneas a presenter at theBetteshangerSummer School and Conference on Biodynamic Farming at Northbourne's farm in Kent.[40]One of the chief purposes of the conference was to bring together the proponents of various approaches to organic agriculture in order that they might cooperate within a larger movement. Howard attended the conference, where he met Pfeiffer.[41]In the following year, Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming,Look to the Land, in which he coined the term \"organic farming\". The Betteshanger conference has been described as the 'missing link' between biodynamic agriculture and other forms of organic farming.[40]\nIn 1940 Howard published hisAn Agricultural Testament. In this book he adopted Northbourne's terminology of \"organic farming\".[42]Howard's work spread widely, and he became known as the \"father of organic farming\" for his work in applying scientific knowledge and principles to various traditional and natural methods.[26]:\u200a45In the United StatesJ. I. Rodale, who was keenly interested both in Howard's ideas and in biodynamics,[29]founded in the 1940s both a working organic farm for trials and experimentation,The Rodale Institute, andRodale, Inc.inEmmaus, Pennsylvaniato teach and advocate organic methods to the wider public. These became important influences on the spread of organic agriculture. Further work was done byLady Eve Balfour(theHaughley Experiment) in the United Kingdom, and many others across the world.\nThe term \"eco-agriculture\" was coined in 1970 byCharles Walters, founder ofAcres Magazine, to describe agriculture which does not use \"man-made molecules of toxic rescue chemistry\", effectively another name for organic agriculture.[43]\nIncreasing environmental awareness in the general population in modern times has transformed the originally supply-driven organic movement to a demand-driven one. Premium prices and some government subsidies attracted farmers. In the developing world, many producers farm according to traditional methods that are comparable to organic farming, but not certified, and that may not include the latest scientific advancements in organic agriculture. In other cases, farmers in the developing world have converted to modern organic methods for economic reasons.[44]\nThe use of \"organic\" popularized by Howard and Rodale refers more narrowly to the use oforganic matterderived from plant compost and animal manures to improve thehumuscontent of soils, grounded in the work of early soil scientists who developed what was then called \"humus farming\". Since the early 1940s the two camps have tended to merge.[45][46]\nBiodynamic agriculturists, on the other hand, used the term \"organic\" to indicate that a farm should be viewed as a living organism,[34]:\u200a17\u201319[40]in the sense of the following quotation:\nAn organic farm, properly speaking, is not one that uses certain methods and substances and avoids others; it is a farm whose structure is formed in imitation of the structure of a natural system that has the integrity, the independence and the benign dependence of an organism\nThey based their work on Steiner's spiritually-oriented alternative agriculture which includes various esoteric concepts.\n\"Organic agriculture is a production system that sustains the health of soils,ecosystemsand people. It relies on ecological processes,biodiversityand cycles adapted to local conditions, rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects. Organic agriculture combines tradition, innovation and science to benefit the shared environment and promote fair relationships and a good quality of life for all involved...\"\nOrganic farming methods combine scientific knowledge of ecology and some moderntechnologywithtraditional farmingpractices based on naturally occurring biological processes. Organic farming methods are studied in the field ofagroecology. While conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and water-soluble synthetically purified fertilizers, organic farmers are restricted by regulations to using natural pesticides and fertilizers. An example of a natural pesticide ispyrethrin, which is found naturally in theChrysanthemumflower. The principal methods of organic farming includecrop rotation,green manuresandcompost,biological pest control, and mechanicalcultivation. These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity:legumesare planted to fixnitrogeninto the soil,natural insect predatorsare encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural materials such aspotassium bicarbonate[48]andmulchesare used to control disease andweeds.Genetically modifiedseeds and animals are excluded.\nWhile organic is fundamentally different from conventional because of the use of carbon-based fertilizers compared with highly soluble synthetic based fertilizers andbiological pest controlinstead of synthetic pesticides, organic farming and large-scale conventional farming are not entirely mutually exclusive. Many of the methods developed for organic agriculture have been borrowed by more conventional agriculture. For example,Integrated Pest Managementis a multifaceted strategy that uses various organic methods of pest control whenever possible, but in conventional farming could include syntheticpesticidesonly as a last resort.[49]Examples of beneficial insects that are used in organic farming include ladybugs and lacewings, both of which feed on aphids. The use of IPM lowers the possibility of pest developing resistance to pesticides that are applied to crops.\nOrganic farming encouragescrop diversityby promotingpolyculture(multiple crops in the same space). Planting a variety ofvegetablecrops supports a wider range of beneficial insects, soil microorganisms, and other factors that add up to overall farm health.Cropdiversity helps the environment to thrive and protects species from going extinct.[50][51]The science ofAgroecologyhas revealed the benefits of polyculture, which is often employed in organic farming. Agroecology is a scientific discipline that uses ecological theory to study, design, manage, and evaluateagriculturalsystems that are productive and resource-conserving, and that are also culturally sensitive, socially just, and economically viable.[52]\nIncorporating crop diversity into organic farming practices can have several benefits. For instance, it can help to increasesoilfertility by promoting the growth of beneficial soilmicroorganisms. It can also help to reduce pest and disease pressure by creating a more diverse and resilientagroecosystem.[53]Furthermore, crop diversity can help to improve the nutritional quality of food by providing a wider range of essentialnutrients.[54]\nOrganic farming relies more heavily on the natural breakdown of organic matter than the average conventional farm, using techniques likegreen manureandcomposting, to replace nutrients taken from the soil by previous crops. This biological process, driven bymicroorganismssuch asmycorrhizaandearthworms, releases nutrients available to plants throughout the growing season. Farmers use a variety of methods to improve soil fertility, including crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and application of compost. By reducing fuel-intensive tillage, less soil organic matter is lost to the atmosphere. This has an added benefit ofcarbon sequestration, which reduces greenhouse gases and helps reverse climate change. Reducing tillage may also improve soil structure and reduce the potential for soil erosion.\nPlants needa large number of nutrients in various quantities to flourish. Supplying enoughnitrogenand particularly synchronization, so that plants get enough nitrogen at the time when they need it most, is a challenge for organic farmers.[55]Crop rotationand green manure (\"cover crops\") help to provide nitrogen throughlegumes(more precisely, the familyFabaceae), which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through symbiosis withrhizobialbacteria.Intercropping, which is sometimes used for insect and disease control, can also increase soil nutrients, but the competition between the legume and the crop can be problematic and wider spacing between crop rows is required.Crop residuescan beploughedback into the soil, and different plants leave different amounts of nitrogen, potentially aiding synchronization.[55]Organic farmers also use animalmanure, certain processed fertilizers such as seed meal and variousmineralpowders such asrock phosphateandgreen sand, a naturally occurring form ofpotashthat provides potassium. In some casespHmay need to be amended. Natural pH amendments includelimeandsulfur, but in the U.S. some compounds such asiron sulfate,aluminum sulfate,magnesium sulfate, and solubleboronproducts are allowed in organic farming.[56]:\u200a43\nMixed farms with bothlivestockandcropscan operate asley farms, whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogen-fixingforagegrasses such aswhite cloveroralfalfaand growscash cropsorcerealswhen fertility is established. Farms without livestock (\"stockless\") may find it more difficult to maintain soil fertility, and may rely more on external inputs such as importedmanureas well as grain legumes and green manures, although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested.Horticulturalfarms that grow fruits and vegetables in protected conditions often rely even more on external inputs.[55]Manure is very bulky and is often not cost-effective to transport more than a short distance from the source. Manure for organic farms' may become scarce if a sizable number of farms become organically managed.\nOrganicweedmanagement promotes weed suppression, rather than weed elimination, by enhancing crop competition andphytotoxiceffects on weeds.[57]Organic farmers integrate cultural, biological, mechanical, physical and chemical tactics to manage weeds without syntheticherbicides.\nOrganic standards requirerotationof annual crops,[58]meaning that a single crop cannot be grown in the same location without a different, intervening crop. Organic crop rotations frequently include weed-suppressivecover cropsand crops with dissimilar life cycles to discourage weeds associated with a particular crop.[57]Research is ongoing to develop organic methods to promote the growth of natural microorganisms that suppress the growth or germination of common weeds.[59]\nOther cultural practices used to enhance crop competitiveness and reduce weed pressure include selection of competitive crop varieties, high-density planting, tight row spacing, and late planting into warm soil to encourage rapid cropgermination.[57]\nMechanical and physical weed control practices used on organic farms can be broadly grouped as:[60]\nSome naturally sourced chemicals are allowed for herbicidal use. These include certain formulations ofacetic acid(concentrated vinegar),corn gluten meal, andessential oils. A few selectivebioherbicidesbased on fungalpathogenshave also been developed. At this time, however, organic herbicides andbioherbicidesplay a minor role in the organic weed control toolbox.[60]\nWeeds can be controlled by grazing. For example, geese have been used successfully to weed a range of organic crops including cotton, strawberries, tobacco, and corn,[62]reviving the practice of keepingcotton patch geese, common in the southern U.S. before the 1950s. Similarly, some rice farmers introduce ducks and fish to wetpaddy fieldsto eat both weeds and insects.[63]\nOrganisms aside from weeds that cause problems on farms includearthropods(e.g., insects,mites),nematodes,fungiandbacteria. Practices include, but are not limited to:\nExamples of predatory beneficial insects includeminute pirate bugs,big-eyed bugs, and to a lesser extentladybugs(which tend to fly away), all of which eat a wide range of pests.Lacewingsare also effective, but tend to fly away.Praying mantistend to move more slowly and eat less heavily.Parasitoid waspstend to be effective for their selected prey, but like all small insects can be less effective outdoors because the wind controls their movement. Predatory mites are effective for controlling other mites.[56]:\u200a66\u201390\nNaturally derivedinsecticidesallowed for use on organic farms includeBacillus thuringiensis(a bacterial toxin),pyrethrum(a chrysanthemum extract),spinosad(a bacterial metabolite),neem(a tree extract) androtenone(a legume root extract). Fewer than 10% of organic farmers use these pesticides regularly; a 2003 survey found that only 5.3% of vegetable growers in California use rotenone while 1.7% use pyrethrum.[64]:\u200a26These pesticides are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm.[56]:\u200a92The main criterion for organic pesticides is that they are naturally derived, and some naturally derived substances have been controversial. Controversial natural pesticides include rotenone,copper,nicotine sulfate, and pyrethrums[65][66]Rotenone and pyrethrum are particularly controversial because they work by attacking the nervous system, like most conventional insecticides. Rotenone is extremely toxic to fish[67]and can induce symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease in mammals.[68][69]Although pyrethrum (natural pyrethrins) is more effective against insects when used with piperonyl butoxide (which retards degradation of the pyrethrins),[70]organic standards generally do not permit use of the latter substance.[71][72][73]\nNaturally derivedfungicidesallowed for use on organic farms include the bacteriaBacillus subtilisandBacillus pumilus; and the fungusTrichoderma harzianum. These are mainly effective for diseases affecting roots.Compost teacontains a mix of beneficial microbes, which may attack or out-compete certain plant pathogens,[74]but variability among formulations and preparation methods may contribute to inconsistent results or even dangerous growth of toxic microbes in compost teas.[75]\nSome naturally derived pesticides are not allowed for use on organic farms. These include nicotine sulfate,arsenic, andstrychnine.[76]\nSynthetic pesticides allowed for use on organic farms includeinsecticidal soapsandhorticultural oilsfor insect management; andBordeaux mixture,copper hydroxideandsodium bicarbonatefor managing fungi.[76]Copper sulfate and Bordeaux mixture (copper sulfate plus lime), approved for organic use in various jurisdictions,[71][72][76]can be more environmentally problematic than some synthetic fungicides disallowed in organic farming.[77][78]Similar concerns apply to copper hydroxide. Repeated application of copper sulfate or copper hydroxide as a fungicide may eventually result in copper accumulation to toxic levels in soil,[79]and admonitions to avoid excessive accumulations of copper in soil appear in various organic standards and elsewhere. Environmental concerns for several kinds of biota arise at average rates of use of such substances for some crops.[80]In the European Union, where replacement of copper-based fungicides in organic agriculture is a policy priority,[81]research is seeking alternatives for organic production.[82]\nRaising livestock and poultry, for meat, dairy and eggs, is another traditional farming activity that complements growing. Organic farms attempt to provide animals with natural living conditions and feed. Organic certification verifies that livestock are raised according to the USDA organic regulations throughout their lives.[83]These regulations include the requirement that all animal feed must be certified organic.\nOrganic livestock may be, and must be, treated with medicine when they are sick, but drugs cannot be used to promote growth, their feed must be organic, and they must be pastured.[84]:\u200a19ff[85]\nAlso, horses and cattle were once a basic farm feature that provided labour, for hauling and plowing, fertility, through recycling of manure, and fuel, in the form of food for farmers and other animals. While today, small growing operations often do not include livestock, domesticated animals are a desirable part of the organic farming equation, especially for true sustainability, the ability of a farm to function as a self-renewing unit.\nA key characteristic of organic farming is the exclusion of genetically engineered plants and animals. On 19 October 1998, participants at IFOAM's 12th Scientific Conference issued theMar del Plata Declaration, where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms in organic food production and agriculture.\nAlthough opposition to the use of any transgenic technologies in organic farming is strong, agricultural researchers Luis Herrera-Estrella and Ariel Alvarez-Morales continue to advocate integration oftransgenictechnologies into organic farming as the optimal means to sustainable agriculture, particularly in the developing world.[86]Organic farmer Raoul Adamchak and geneticistPamela Ronaldwrite that many agricultural applications ofbiotechnologyare consistent with organic principles and have significantly advanced sustainable agriculture.[87]\nAlthough GMOs are excluded from organic farming, there is concern that the pollen from genetically modified crops is increasingly penetrating organic andheirloom seed stocks, making it difficult, if not impossible, to keep these genomes from entering the organic food supply. Differing regulations among countries limits the availability of GMOs to certain countries, as described in the article onregulation of the release of genetic modified organisms.\nOrganic farmers use a number of traditionalfarm toolsto do farming, and may make use ofagricultural machineryin similar ways to conventional farming. In the developing world, on small organic farms, tools are normally constrained to hand tools anddieselpowered water pumps.\nStandards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture. Standards may be voluntary or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s, governments began to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most notably with the 1991EU-Eco-regulationdeveloped forEuropean Union,[88]which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK program. The EU's program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created theNational Organic Program(NOP).[89]As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming (IFOAM 2007:11). In 2005 IFOAM created thePrinciples of Organic Agriculture, an international guideline for certification criteria.[90]Typically the agencies accredit certification groups rather than individual farms.\nProduction materials used for the creation of USDA Organic certified foods require the approval of a NOP accredited certifier.\nEU-organic production-regulationon \"organic\" food labels define \"organic\" primarily in terms of whether \"natural\" or \"artificial\" substances were allowed as inputs in the food production process.[91]\nUsing manure as a fertilizer risks contaminating food with animal gut bacteria, including pathogenic strains of E. coli that have caused fatal poisoning from eating organic food.[92]To combat this risk,USDAorganic standards require that manure must be sterilized through high temperaturethermophilic composting. If raw animal manure is used, 120 days must pass before the crop is harvested if the final product comes into direct contact with the soil. For products that do not directly contact soil, 90 days must pass prior to harvest.[93]\nIn the US, the Organic Food Production Act of 1990 (OFPA) as amended, specifies that a farm can not be certified as organic if the compost being used contains any synthetic ingredients. The OFPA singles out commercially blended fertilizers [composts] disallowing the use of any fertilizer [compost] that contains prohibited materials.[94]\nTheeconomicsof organic farming, a subfield ofagricultural economics, encompasses the entire process and effects of organic farming in terms of human society, includingsocial costs,opportunity costs,unintended consequences,information asymmetries, andeconomies of scale.\nLabour input, carbon andmethane emissions, energy use, eutrophication, acidification, soil quality, effect on biodiversity, and overall land use vary considerably between individual farms and between crops, making general comparisons between the economics of organic and conventional agriculture difficult.[95][96]\nIn theEuropean Union\"organic farmers receive more subsidies under agri-environment and animal welfare subsidies than conventional growers\".[97]\nThe markets for organic products are strongest in North America and Europe, which as of 2001 are estimated to have $6 and $8 billion respectively of the $20 billion global market.[64]:\u200a6As of 2007Australasiahas 39% of the total organic farmland, including Australia's 11,800,000 hectares (29,000,000 acres) but 97% of this land is sprawlingrangeland(2007:35). US sales are 20x as much.[64]:\u200a7Europe farms 23% of global organic farmland (6,900,000\u00a0ha (17,000,000 acres)), followed byLatin America and the Caribbeanwith 20% (6,400,000\u00a0ha (16,000,000 acres)). Asia has 9.5% while North America has 7.2%. Africa has 3%.[98]\nBesides Australia,[99]the countries with the most organic farmland are Argentina (3.1\u00a0million hectares (7.7\u00a0million acres)), China (2.3\u00a0million hectares (5.7\u00a0million acres)), and the United States (1.6\u00a0million hectares (4.0\u00a0million acres)). Much of Argentina's organic farmland is pasture, like that of Australia (2007:42). Spain, Germany, Brazil (the world's largest agricultural exporter), Uruguay, and England follow the United States in the amount of organic land (2007:26).\nIn the European Union (EU25) 3.9% of the total utilized agricultural area was used for organic production in 2005. The countries with the highest proportion of organic land were Austria (11%) and Italy (8.4%), followed by the Czech Republic and Greece (both 7.2%). The lowest figures were shown for Malta (0.2%), Poland (0.6%) and Ireland (0.8%).[100][101]In 2009, the proportion of organic land in the EU grew to 4.7%. The countries with the highest share of agricultural land were Liechtenstein (26.9%), Austria (18.5%) and Sweden (12.6%).[102]16% of all farmers in Austria produced organically in 2010. By the same year the proportion of organic land increased to 20%.[103]In 2005, 168,000 hectares (420,000 acres) of land in Poland was under organic management.[104]In 2012, 288,261 hectares (712,310 acres) were under organic production, and there were about 15,500 organic farmers; retail sales of organic products were EUR 80 million in 2011. As of 2012 organic exports were part of the government's economic development strategy.[105]\nAfter the collapse of theSoviet Unionin 1991, agricultural inputs that had previously been purchased fromEastern bloccountries were no longer available in Cuba, and many Cuban farms converted to organic methods out of necessity.[106]Consequently, organic agriculture is a mainstream practice in Cuba, while it remains an alternative practice in most other countries.[107][108]Cuba's organic strategy includes development ofgenetically modified crops; specifically corn that is resistant to the palomilla moth.[107]\nIn 2001, the global market value of certified organic products was estimated at US$20 billion. By 2002, this was US$23 billion and by 2015 more than US$43 billion.[109]By 2014, retail sales of organic products reached US$80 billion worldwide.[110]North America and Europe accounted for more than 90% of all organic product sales.[110]In 2018 Australia accounted for 54% of the world's certified organic land with the country recording more than 35,000,000 verified organic hectares (86,000,000 acres).[111]\nOrganic agricultural land increased almost fourfold in 15 years, from 11\u00a0million hectares (27\u00a0million acres) in 1999 to 43.7\u00a0million hectares (108\u00a0million acres) in 2014.[110]Between 2013 and 2014, organic agricultural land grew by 500\u00a0thousand hectares (1,200,000 acres) worldwide, increasing in every region except Latin America.[110]During this time period, Europe's organic farmland increased 260\u00a0thousand hectares (640,000 acres) to 11.6\u00a0million hectares (29\u00a0million acres) (+2.3%), Asia's increased 159\u00a0thousand hectares (390,000 acres) to 3.6\u00a0million hectares (8.9\u00a0million acres) (+4.7%), Africa's increased 54\u00a0thousand hectares (130,000 acres) to 1.3\u00a0million hectares (3.2\u00a0million acres) total (+4.5%), and North America's increased 35\u00a0thousand hectares (86,000 acres) to 3.1\u00a0million hectares (7.7\u00a0million acres) total (+1.1%).[110]As of 2014, the country with the most organic land was Australia (17.2\u00a0million hectares (43\u00a0million acres)), followed by Argentina (3.1\u00a0million hectares (7.7\u00a0million acres)), and the United States (2.2\u00a0million hectares (5.4\u00a0million acres)).[110]Australia's organic land area has increased at a rate of 16.5% per annum for the past eighteen years.[111]\nIn 2013, the number of organic producers grew by almost 270,000, or more than 13%.[110]By 2014, there were a reported 2.3 million organic producers in the world.[110]Most of the total global increase took place in the Philippines, Peru, China, and Thailand.[110]Overall, the majority of all organic producers are in India (650,000 in 2013), Uganda (190,552 in 2014), Mexico (169,703 in 2013) and the Philippines (165,974 in 2014).[110]\nIn 2016, organic farming produced over 1\u00a0million metric tons (980,000 long tons; 1,100,000 short tons) of bananas, over 800\u00a0thousand metric tons (790,000 long tons; 880,000 short tons) of soybean, and just under 500\u00a0thousand metric tons (490,000 long tons; 550,000 short tons) of coffee.[112]\nStudies comparing yields have had mixed results.[113]These differences among findings can often be attributed to variations between study designs including differences in the crops studied and the methodology by which results were gathered.\nA 2012 meta-analysis found that productivity is typically lower for organic farming than conventional farming, but that the size of the difference depends on context and in some cases may be very small.[114]While organic yields can be lower than conventional yields, another meta-analysis published in Sustainable Agriculture Research in 2015, concluded that certain organic on-farm practices could help narrow this gap. Timely weed management and the application of manure in conjunction with legume forages/cover crops were shown to have positive results in increasing organic corn and soybean productivity.\nAnother meta-analysis published in the journalAgricultural Systemsin 2011 analyzed 362 datasets and found that organic yields were on average 80% of conventional yields. The author's found that there are relative differences in this yield gap based on crop type with crops like soybeans and rice scoring higher than the 80% average and crops like wheat and potato scoring lower. Across global regions, Asia and Central Europe were found to have relatively higher yields and Northern Europe relatively lower than the average.[115]\nA study published in 2005 compared conventional cropping, organic animal-based cropping, and organic legume-based cropping on a test farm at theRodale Instituteover 22 years.[116]The study found that \"the crop yields for corn and soybeans were similar in the organic animal, organic legume, and conventional farming systems\". It also found that \"significantly lessfossil energywas expended to produce corn in the Rodale Institute's organic animal and organic legume systems than in the conventional production system. There was little difference in energy input between the different treatments for producing soybeans. In the organic systems, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides were generally not used\". As of 2013 the Rodale study was ongoing[117]and a thirty-year anniversary report was published by Rodale in 2012.[118]\nA long-term field study comparing organic/conventional agriculture carried out over 21 years in Switzerland concluded that \"Crop yields of the organic systems averaged over 21 experimental years at 80% of the conventional ones. The fertilizer input, however, was 34 \u2013 51% lower, indicating an efficient production. The organic farming systems used 20 \u2013 56% less energy to produce a crop unit and per land area this difference was 36 \u2013 53%. In spite of the considerably lower pesticide input the quality of organic products was hardly discernible from conventional analytically and even came off better in food preference trials and picture creating methods.\"[119]\nIn the United States, organic farming has been shown to be 2.7 to 3.8 times more profitable for the farmer than conventional farming when prevailing price premiums are taken into account.[120]Globally, organic farming is 22\u201335% more profitable for farmers than conventional methods, according to a 2015 meta-analysis of studies conducted across five continents.[121]\nThe profitability of organic agriculture can be attributed to a number of factors. First, organic farmers do not rely on synthetic fertilizer and pesticide inputs, which can be costly. In addition, organic foods currently enjoy a price premium over conventionally produced foods, meaning that organic farmers can often get more for their yield.\nThe price premium for organic food is an important factor in the economic viability of organic farming. In 2013 there was a 100% price premium on organic vegetables and a 57% price premium for organic fruits. These percentages are based on wholesale fruit and vegetable prices, available through the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.[122]Price premiums exist not only for organic versus nonorganic crops, but may also vary depending on the venue where the product is sold: farmers' markets, grocery stores, or wholesale to restaurants. For many producers, direct sales at farmers' markets are most profitable because the farmer receives the entire markup, however this is also the most time and labour-intensive approach.[123]\nThere have been signs of organic price premiums narrowing in recent years, which lowers the economic incentive for farmers to convert to or maintain organic production methods.[124]Data from 22 years of experiments at the Rodale Institute found that, based on the current yields and production costs associated with organic farming in the United States, a price premium of only 10% is required to achieve parity with conventional farming.[124]A separate study found that on a global scale, price premiums of only 5-7% were needed to break even with conventional methods.[121]Without the price premium, profitability for farmers is mixed.[64]:\u200a11\nFor markets and supermarkets organic food is profitable as well, and is generally sold at significantly higher prices than non-organic food.[125]\nCompared to conventional agriculture, the energy efficiency of organic farming depends upon crop type and farm size.[96][126]\nTwo studies \u2013 both comparing organically- versus conventionally-farmed apples \u2013 declare contradicting results, one saying organic farming is more energy efficient, the other saying conventionally is more efficient.[126][127]\nIt has generally been found that the labor input per unit of yield was higher for organic systems compared with conventional production.[126]\nMost sales are concentrated in developed nations. In 2008, 69% of Americans claimed to occasionally buy organic products, down from 73% in 2005. One theory for this change was that consumers were substituting \"local\" produce for \"organic\" produce.[128][129]\nTheUSDArequires that distributors, manufacturers, and processors of organic products be certified by an accredited state or private agency.[130]In 2007, there were 3,225 certified organic handlers, up from 2,790 in 2004.[131]\nOrganic handlers are often small firms; 48% reported sales below $1 million annually, and 22% between $1 and $5 million per year.[132]Smaller handlers are more likely to sell to independent natural grocery stores and natural product chains whereas large distributors more often market to natural product chains and conventional supermarkets, with a small group marketing to independent natural product stores.[131]Some handlers work with conventional farmers to convert their land to organic with the knowledge that the farmer will have a secure sales outlet. This lowers the risk for the handler as well as the farmer. In 2004, 31% of handlers provided technical support on organic standards or production to their suppliers and 34% encouraged their suppliers to transition to organic.[130]Smaller farms often join incooperativesto market their goods more effectively.\n93% of organic sales are through conventional and natural food supermarkets and chains, while the remaining 7% of U.S. organic food sales occur through farmers' markets,foodservices, and other marketing channels.[133]\nIn the 2012 Census, direct-to-consumer sales equalled $1.3 billion, up from $812 million in 2002, an increase of 60 percent. The number of farms that utilize direct-to-consumer sales was 144,530 in 2012 in comparison to 116,733 in 2002.[134]Direct-to-consumer sales include farmers' markets,community supported agriculture(CSA), on-farm stores, and roadside farm stands. Some organic farms also sell products direct to retailer, direct to restaurant and direct to institution.[135]According to the 2008 Organic Production Survey, approximately 7% of organic farm sales were direct-to-consumers, 10% went direct to retailers, and approximately 83% went into wholesale markets. In comparison, only 0.4% of the value of convention agricultural commodities were direct-to-consumers.[136]\nWhile not all products sold at farmer's markets are certified organic, this direct-to-consumer avenue has become increasingly popular in local food distribution and has grown substantially since 1994. In 2014, there were 8,284 farmer's markets in comparison to 3,706 in 2004 and 1,755 in 1994, most of which are found in populated areas such as the Northeast, Midwest, and West Coast.[137]\nOrganic production is more labour-intensive than conventional production.[138]Increased labor cost is one factor that contributes to organic food being more expensive.[138]Organic farming's increased labor requirements can be seen in a good way providing more job opportunities for people. The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report suggests that \"[a]n increase in investment in green agriculture is projected to lead to growth in employment of about 60 per cent compared with current levels\" and that \"green agriculture investments could create 47 million additional jobs compared with BAU2 over the next 40 years\".[139]\nMuch of the growth in women labour participation in agriculture is outside the \"male dominated field of conventional agriculture\". Organic farming has a greater percentage of women working in the farms with 21% compared to farming in general with 14%.\nIn 2007 the United NationsFood and Agriculture Organization(FAO) said that organic agriculture often leads to higher prices and hence a better income for farmers, so it should be promoted. However, FAO stressed that organic farming could not feed the current human population, much less the larger future population. Both data and models showed that organic farming was far from sufficient. Therefore, chemical fertilizers were needed to avoid hunger.[140]Others have argued that organic farming is particularly well-suited to food-insecure areas, and therefore could be \"an important part of increased food security\" in places like sub-Saharan Africa[141]\nFAO stressed that fertilizers and other chemical inputs can increase production, particularly in Africa where fertilizers are currently used 90% less than in Asia.[140]For example, in Malawi the yield has been boosted using seeds and fertilizers.[140]\nAlsoNEPAD, a development organization of African governments, announced that feeding Africans and preventing malnutrition requires fertilizers and enhanced seeds.[142]\nAccording to a 2012 study from McGill University, organic best management practices show an average yield only 13% less than conventional.[143]In the world's poorer nations where most of the world's hungry live, and where conventional agriculture's expensive inputs are not affordable for the majority of farmers, adopting organic management actually increases yields 93% on average, and could be an important part of increased food security.[141][144]\nOrganic agriculture can contribute to ecological sustainability, especially in poorer countries.[145]The application of organic principles enables employment of local resources (e.g., local seed varieties, manure, etc.) and therefore cost-effectiveness. Local and international markets for organic products show tremendous growth prospects and offer creative producers and exporters excellent opportunities to improve their income and living conditions.[146]\nOrganic agriculture is knowledge intensive. Globally, capacity building efforts are underway, including localized training material, to limited effect. As of 2007, theInternational Federation of Organic Agriculture Movementshosted more than 170 free manuals and 75 training opportunities online.[citation needed]\nIn 2008 theUnited Nations Environmental Programme(UNEP) and theUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD) stated that \"organic agriculture can be more conducive to food security in Africa than most conventional production systems, and that it is more likely to be sustainable in the long-term\"[147]and that \"yields had more than doubled where organic, or near-organic practices had been used\" and that soil fertility anddrought resistanceimproved.[148]\nThe value of organic agriculture (OA) in the achievement of theMillennium Development Goals(MDG), particularly in poverty reduction efforts in the face of climate change, is shown by its contribution to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These benefits are expected to continue in the post-MDG era. A series of case studies conducted in selected areas in Asian countries by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and published as a book compilation by ADB in Manila document these contributions to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These include poverty alleviation by way of higher incomes, improved farmers' health owing to less chemical exposure, integration of sustainable principles into rural development policies, improvement of access to safe water and sanitation, and expansion of global partnership for development as small farmers are integrated in value chains.[149]\nA related ADBI study also sheds on the costs of OA programs and set them in the context of the costs of attaining the MDGs. The results show considerable variation across the case studies, suggesting that there is no clear structure to the costs of adopting OA. Costs depend on the efficiency of the OA adoption programs. The lowest cost programs were more than ten times less expensive than the highest cost ones. However, further analysis of the gains resulting from OA adoption reveals that the costs per person taken out of poverty was much lower than the estimates of the World Bank,[150]based on income growth in general or based on the detailed costs of meeting some of the more quantifiable MDGs (e.g., education, health, and environment).[151]\nAgriculture imposes negativeexternalitiesupon society through public land and other public resource use, biodiversity loss,erosion,pesticides,nutrient pollution, and assorted other problems. Positive externalities include self-reliance, entrepreneurship, respect for nature, and air quality.[citation needed]Organic methods differ from conventional methods in the impacts of their respective externalities, dependent on implementation and crop type. Overall land use is generally higher for organic methods, but organic methods generally use less energy in production.[96][152]The analysis and comparison of externalities is complicated by whether the comparison is done using a per unit area measurement or per unit of production, and whether analysis is done on isolated plots or on farm units as a whole.[153]\nMeasurements of biodiversity are highly variable between studies, farms, and organism groups. \"Birds, predatory insects, soil organisms and plants responded positively to organic farming, while non-predatory insects and pests did not. A 2005 review found that the positive effects of organic farming on abundance were prominent at the plot and field scales, but not for farms in matched landscapes.\"[154]\nOther studies that have attempted to examine and compare conventional and organic systems of farming and have found that organic techniques reduce levels of biodiversity less than conventional systems do, and use less energy and produce less waste when calculated per unit area, although not when calculated per unit of output. \"Farm comparisons show that actual (nitrate) leaching rates per hectare[/acre] are up to 57% lower on organic than on conventional fields. However, the leaching rates per unit of output were similar or slightly higher.\" \"On a per-hectare[/-acre] scale, the CO2emissions are 40\u00a0\u2013 60% lower in organic farming systems than in conventional ones, whereas on a per-unit output scale, the CO2emissions tend to be higher in organic farming systems.\"[153][155]\nIt has been proposed that organic agriculture can reduce the level of some negative externalities from (conventional) agriculture. Whether the benefits are private, or public depends upon the division of property rights.[156]\nAccording to a meta analysis published in 2017, compared to conventional agriculture, biological agriculture has a higher land requirement per yield unit, a higher eutrophication potential, a higher acidification potential and a lower energy requirement, but is associated with similarly high greenhouse gas emissions.[96]\nA 2003 to 2005 investigation by theCranfield Universityfor theDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsin the UK found that it is difficult to compare theglobal warming potential, acidification and eutrophication emissions but \"Organic production often results in increased burdens, from factors such as nitrogen leaching and N2O emissions\", even though primary energy use was less for most organic products. N2O is always the largest global warming potential contributor except in tomatoes. However, \"organic tomatoes always incur more burdens (except pesticide use)\". Some emissions were lower \"per area\", but organic farming always required 65 to 200% more field area than non-organic farming. The numbers were highest for bread wheat (200+\u00a0% more) and potatoes (160% more).[158][159]\nAs of 2020 it seems that organic agriculture can help in mitigating climate change but only if used in certain ways.[160]\nResearchers at Oxford University analysed 71 peer-reviewed studies and observed that organic products are sometimes worse for the environment.[161]Organic milk, cereals, and pork generated highergreenhouse gas emissionsper product than conventional ones but organic beef and olives had lower emissions in most studies.[161]Usually organic products required less energy, but more land.[161]Per unit of product, organic produce generates higher nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions, ammonia emissions,eutrophication, and acidification potential than conventionally grown produce.[162]Other differences were not significant.[162]The researchers concluded that public debate should consider various manners of employing conventional or organic farming, and not merely debate conventional farming as opposed to organic farming. They also sought to find specific solutions to specific circumstances.[162][clarification needed]\nA 2018 review article in theAnnual Review of Resource Economicsfound that organic agriculture is more polluting per unit of output and that widespread upscaling of organic agriculture would cause additional loss of natural habitats.[163]\nProponents of organic farming have claimed that organic agriculture emphasizes closednutrient cycles, biodiversity, and effectivesoil managementproviding the capacity to mitigate and even reverse the effects ofclimate change[164]and that organic agriculture can decreasefossil fuel emissions.[165]\"The carbon sequestration efficiency of organic systems in temperate climates is almost double (575\u2013700 kilograms per hectare per year (16.3\u201319.8\u00a0lb/acre/Ms)) that of conventional treatment of soils, mainly owing to the use of grass clovers for feed and of cover crops in organic rotations.\"[166]However, studies acknowledge organic systems require more acreage to produce the same yield as conventional farms. By converting to organic farms in developed countries where most arable land is accounted for,[167]increased deforestation would decrease overall carbon sequestration.[168]\nAccording to a 2012meta-analysisof 71 studies, nitrogen leaching,nitrous oxideemissions, ammonia emissions, eutrophication potential and acidification potential were higher for organic products. Specifically, the emission per area of land is lower, but per amount of food produced is higher.[162]This is due to the lower crop yield of organic farms. Excess nutrients in lakes, rivers, and groundwater can causealgal blooms,eutrophication, and subsequentdead zones. In addition,nitratesare harmful to aquatic organisms by themselves.[169]\nA 2012 Oxford meta-analysis of 71 studies found that organic farming requires 84% more land for an equivalent amount of harvest, mainly due to lack of nutrients but sometimes due to weeds, diseases or pests, lower yielding animals and land required for fertility building crops.[162]While organic farming does not necessarily save land for wildlife habitats and forestry in all cases,[161]the most modern breakthroughs in organic are addressing these issues with success.[170][171][172]\nProfessor Wolfgang Branscheid says that organic animal production is not good for the environment, because organic chicken requires twice as much land as \"conventional\" chicken and organic pork a quarter more.[173]According to a calculation by Hudson Institute, organic beef requires three times as much land.[174]On the other hand, certain organic methods of animal husbandry have been shown to restore desertified, marginal, and/or otherwise unavailable land to agricultural productivity and wildlife.[175][176]Or by getting both forage and cash crop production from the same fields simultaneously, reduce net land use.[177]\nSRI methods for rice production, without external inputs, have produced record yields on some farms,[178][179]but not others.[180]\nIn organic farming the use of synthetic pesticides and certain natural compounds that are produced using chemical synthesis are prohibited. The organic labels restrictions are not only based on the nature of the compound, but also on the method of production.\nA non-exhaustive list of organic approved pesticides with theirmedian lethal doses:\nWhile there may be some differences in the amounts of nutrients and anti-nutrients when organically produced food and conventionally-produced food are compared, the variable nature of food production and handling makes it difficult to generalize results, and there is insufficient evidence to make claims that organic food is safer or healthier than conventional food.[185][186][187][188][189]\nSupporters claim that organically managed soil has a higherquality[190]and higherwater retention.[191]This may help increase yields for organic farms in drought years. Organic farming can build up soil organic matter better than conventional no-till farming, which suggests long-term yield benefits from organic farming.[192]An 18-year study of organic methods on nutrient-depleted soil concluded that conventional methods were superior forsoil fertilityand yield for nutrient-depleted soils in cold-temperate climates, arguing that much of the benefit from organic farming derives from imported materials that could not be regarded as self-sustaining.[193]\nInDirt: The Erosion of Civilizations, geomorphologist David Montgomery outlines a coming crisis from soilerosion. Agriculture relies on roughly one meter oftopsoil, and that is being depleted ten times faster than it is being replaced.[194]No-tillfarming, which some claim depends uponpesticides, is one way to minimize erosion. However, a 2007 study by the USDA's Agricultural Research Service has found that manure applications in tilled organic farming are better at building up the soil than no-till.[195][196]\nGunsmoke Farms, a 137 square kilometres (53 square miles) organic farming project inSouth Dakota, suffered from massive soil erosion as result of tiling after it switched to organic farming.[197]\nThe conservation of natural resources and biodiversity is a core principle of organic production. Three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife.[198]Using practices that attract or introduce beneficial insects, provide habitat for birds and mammals, and provide conditions that increase soil biotic diversity serve to supply vital ecological services to organic production systems. Advantages to certified organic operations that implement these types of production practices include: 1) decreased dependence on outside fertility inputs; 2) reduced pest-management costs; 3) more reliable sources of clean water; and 4) better pollination.[199]\nNearly all non-crop, naturally occurring[200]species observed in comparative farm land practice studies show a preference for organic farming both by abundance and diversity.[201][202]An average of 30% more species inhabit organic farms.[203]Birds, butterflies, soil microbes, beetles, earthworms,[204][205]spiders, vegetation, and mammals are particularly affected. Lack of herbicides and pesticides improve biodiversity fitness and population density.[202]Many weed species attract beneficial insects that improve soil qualities and forage on weed pests.[206]Soil-bound organisms often benefit because of increased bacteria populations due to natural fertilizer such as manure, while experiencing reduced intake ofherbicidesand pesticides.[201]Increased biodiversity, especially from beneficial soil microbes andmycorrhizaehave been proposed as an explanation for the high yields experienced by some organic plots, especially in light of the differences seen in a 21-year comparison of organic and control fields.[207]\nOrganic farming contributes to human capital by promoting biodiversity. The presence of various species in organic farms helps to reduce human input, such as fertilizers, and pesticides, which enhances sustainability.\nThe USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) published aFederal Registernotice on 15 January 2016, announcing the National Organic Program (NOP) final guidance on Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation for Certified Organic Operations. Given the broad scope of natural resources which includes soil, water, wetland, woodland and wildlife, the guidance provides examples of practices that support the underlying conservation principles and demonstrate compliance with USDA organic regulations \u00a7 205.200.[199]The final guidance provides organic certifiers and farms with examples of production practices that support conservation principles and comply with the USDA organic regulations, which require operations to maintain or improve natural resources.[199]The final guidance also clarifies the role of certified operations (to submit an OSP to a certifier), certifiers (ensure that the OSP describes or lists practices that explain the operator's monitoring plan and practices to support natural resources and biodiversity conservation), and inspectors (onsite inspection) in the implementation and verification of these production practices.[208]\nA wide range of organisms benefit from organic farming, but it is unclear whether organic methods confer greater benefits than conventional integrated agri-environmental programs.[201]Organic farming is often presented as a more biodiversity-friendly practice, but the generality of the beneficial effects of organic farming is debated as the effects appear often species- and context-dependent, and current research has highlighted the need to quantify the relative effects of local- and landscape-scale management on farmland biodiversity.[209]There are four key issues when comparing the impacts on biodiversity of organic and conventional farming: (1) It remains unclear whether a holistic whole-farm approach (i.e. organic) provides greater benefits to biodiversity than carefully targeted prescriptions applied to relatively small areas of cropped and/or non-cropped habitats within conventional agriculture (i.e. agri-environment schemes); (2) Many comparative studies encounter methodological problems, limiting their ability to draw quantitative conclusions; (3) Our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming in pastoral and upland agriculture is limited; (4) There remains a pressing need for longitudinal, system-level studies in order to address these issues and to fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming, before a full appraisal of its potential role in biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems can be made.[210]\nOrganic agriculture is often considered to be more socially just and economically sustainable for farmworkers than conventional agriculture. However, there is little social science research or consensus as to whether or not organic agriculture provides better working conditions than conventional agriculture.[211]As many consumers equate organic and sustainable agriculture with small-scale, family-owned organizations it is widely interpreted that buying organic supports better conditions for farmworkers than buying with conventional producers.[212]Organic agriculture is generally more labour-intensive due to its dependence on manual practices for fertilization and pest removal. Although illnesses from inputs pose less of a risk[dubious\u2013discuss], hired workers still fall victim to debilitating musculoskeletal disorders associated with agricultural work. The USDA certification requirements outline growing practices and ecological standards but do nothing to codify labour practices. Independent certification initiatives such as the Agricultural Justice Project, Domestic Fair Trade Working Group, and the Food Alliance have attempted to implement farmworker interests but because these initiatives require voluntary participation of organic farms, their standards cannot be widely enforced.[213]Despite the benefit to farmworkers of implementing labour standards, there is little support among the organic community for these social requirements. Many actors of the organic industry believe that enforcing labour standards would be unnecessary,[212]unacceptable,[213]or unviable due to the constraints of the market.[211]\nThe following is a selected list of support given in some regions.\nTheEU-organic production-regulationis a part of theEuropean Union regulationthat sets rules about the production of organicagriculturalandlivestockproducts and how to label them. In the EU, organic farming andorganic foodare more commonly known as ecological or biological.[1]\nThe regulation is derived from the guidelines of theInternational Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements(IFOAM), which is an association of about 800 member organizations in 119 countries.\nAs in the rest of the world, the organic market in Europe continues to grow and more land is farmed organically each year. \"More farmers cultivate organically, more land is certified organic, and more countries report organic farming activities\" as per the 2016 edition of the study \"The World of Organic AgricultureArchived11 November 2017 at theWayback Machine\" according to data from the end of 2014 published byFiBLandIFOAMin 2016.\nDenmarkhas a long ongoing support for converting conventional farming into organic farming, which has been taught in academic classes in universities since 1986. The state began substitutes and has promoted a special national label for products that qualify as organic since 1989. Denmark is thus the first country in the world to substitute organic farming, promoting the concept and organizing the distribution of organic products.[214]Today the government accept applicants for financial support during conversion years, as in Danish regulations farms must not have utilized conventional farming methods such as the usage of pesticides for several years before products can be assessed for qualification as organic. This financial support has in recent years been cut due to organic farming increasing in profitability, and some goods surpassing the profitability of conventional farming in domestic markets. In general, the financial situation of organic farmers in Denmark boomed between 2010 and 2018, while in 2018 serious nationwide long-lasting droughts stagnated the economic results of organic farmers; however, the average farmer still achieved a net positive result that year.[215]In 2021 Denmark's (and Europe's) largest slaughterhouse,Danish Crown, publicized its expectations of stagnating sales of conventional pork domestically, however it expected increasing sales of organic pork and especiallyfree rangeorganic pork.[216]Besides the conversion support, there are still base subsidies for organic farming paid per area of qualified farm land.[217]\nThe first Danish private development organisation, Sams\u00d8kologisk, was established in 2013, by veteran organic farmers from the existing organisation \u00d8kologisk Sams\u00f8. The development organisation has intentions to buy and invest in farmland and then lend the land to young and aspiring farmers seeking to get into farming, especially organic farming. This organisation reports 300 economical active members as of 2021, but does not publish the amount of acquired land or active lenders.[218]\nHowever, the organic farming concept in Denmark is often not limited to organic farming as the definition is globally. Instead, the majority of organic farming is instead \"ecological farming\". The development of this concept has been parallel with the general organic farming movement, and is most often used interchangeable with organic farming. Thus, there is a much stronger focus on the environmental and especially the ecological impact of ecological farming than organic farming. E.g. besides the base substitute for organic farming, farmers can qualify for an extra substitute equal to 2/3 of the base for realizing a specific reduction in the usage of addednitrogento the farmland (also by organic means).[217]There are also parallels to the extended organic movements ofregenerative agriculture, although far from all concepts in regenerative agriculture are included in the national strategy at this time, but exist as voluntary options for each farmer. For these reasons, international organic products do not fulfill the requirements of ecological farming and thus do not receive the domestic label for ecological products, rather they receive the standardEuropean Unionorganic label.\nTheMinistry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraineis the central executive body that develops the regulatory framework for the organic sector in Ukraine, maintains the state registers of certification bodies, operators and organic seeds and planting material, and provides training and professional development for organic inspectors.\nThanks to the hard work on organic legislation by the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine and the organic working group that includes the main players of the Ukraine's organic sector, on 10 July 2018, theVerkhovna Rada of Ukraine(the Ukrainian Parliament) adopted theLaw of Ukraine \u201cOn Basic Principles and Requirements for Organic Production, Circulation and Labelling of Organic Products\u201d No. 2496, which was enacted on 2 August 2019. As of April 2024, organic production, circulation and labelling of organic products in Ukraine is regulated by this law as well as relevantby-laws.\nOne more important governmental institution of the organic sector of Ukraine is theState Service of Ukraine on Food Safety and Consumer Protection. It is the central executive body authorised to conduct state supervision (control) in the field of organic production, circulation and labelling of organic products in accordance with the organic legislation of Ukraine. This includes state supervision (control) over compliance with the legislation in the field of organic production, circulation and labelling of organic products: inspection of certification bodies; random inspection of operators; monitoring of organic products on the market to prevent the entry of non-organic products labelled as organic.\nTheState Institution \u201cEntrepreneurship and Export Promotion Office\u201d(EEPO, Ukraine) contributes to the development of the Ukrainian organic exporters\u2019 potential, promotion of the organic sector and formation of a positive image of Ukraine as a reliable supplier of organic products abroad. EEPO actively supports and organises various events for organic exporters, including national pavilions at key international trade fairs, such asBIOFACH(Nuremberg, Germany), Anuga (Cologne, Germany), SIAL (Paris, France), and Middle East Organic & Natural Products Expo (Dubai, UAE). EEPO also created the Catalogue of Ukrainian Exporters of Organic Products in partnership withOrganic Standardcertification body.\nOrganic farming is Ukraine is also supported by international technical assistance projects and programmes implementation of which is funded and supported by Switzerland, Germany, and other countries. These project/programmes are the Swiss-Ukrainian program\u201cHigher Value Added Trade from the Organic and Dairy Sector in Ukraine\u201d (QFTP), financed by Switzerland and implemented by theResearch Institute of Organic Agriculture(FiBL, Switzerland) in partnership with SAFOSO AG (Switzerland); the Swiss-Ukrainian program\u201cOrganic Trade for Development in Eastern Europe\u201d (OT4D), financed by Switzerland through the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and implemented byIFOAM \u2013 Organics Internationalin partnership HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation and the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL, Switzerland);Project \u201cGerman-Ukrainian Cooperation in Organic Agriculture\u201d (COA).\nThe project/programme representatives provide their expertise during development of the organic legislative framework and implementation of the legislation in the field of organic production, circulation and labelling of organic products and support various activities related to organic farming and production.\nThe Chinese government, especially the local government, has provided various supports for the development of organic agriculture since the 1990s. Organic farming has been recognized by local governments for its potential in promoting sustainable rural development.[219]It is common for local governments to facilitate land access of agribusinesses by negotiating land leasing with local farmers. The government also establishes demonstration organic gardens, provides training for organic food companies to pass certifications, subsidizes organic certification fees, pest repellent lamps, organic fertilizer and so on. The government has also been playing an active role in marketing organic products through organizing organic food expos and branding supports.[220]\nIn India, in 2016, the northern state ofSikkimachieved its goal of converting to 100% organic farming.[221][222][223][224][225]Other states of India, includingKerala,[226][227]Mizoram,Goa,Rajasthan, andMeghalaya, have also declared their intentions to shift to fully organic cultivation.[225]\nThe South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh is also promoting organic farming, especially Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF), which is a form ofregenerative agriculture.[228]\nAs of 2018, India has the largest number of organic farmers in the world and constitutes more than 30% of organic farmers globally.[229]India has 835,000 certified organic producers.[230]However, the total land under organic cultivation is around 2% of overall farmland.[231][232]\nTheDominican Republichas successfully converted a large amount of itsbananacrop to organic.[225]The Dominican Republic accounts for 55% of the world's certified organic bananas.[225]\nThe most noticeable change in Korea's agriculture occurred throughout the 1960s and 1970s. More specifically, the \"Green Revolution\"[233]program where South Korea experienced reforestations and agricultural revolution. Due to a food shortage duringPark Chung Hee's presidency, the government encouraged rice varieties suited for organic farming.[234]Farmers were able to strategize risk minimization efforts by breeding a variety of rice called Japonica with Tongil.[234]They also used less fertilizer and made other economic adjustments to alleviate potential risk factors.[233]\nIn modern society, organic farming and food policies have changed, more specifically since the 1990s. As expected, the guidelines focus on basic dietary recommendations for consumption of nutrients and Korean-style diets.[235]The main reason for this encouragement is that around 88% of countries across the world face forms of malnutrition.[235]Then in 2009, theSpecial Act on Safety Management of Children's Dietary Lifewas passed, restricting foods low in energy and poor in nutrients.[236]It also focused on other nutritional problems Korean students may have had as well.\nIn Thailand, theInstitute for Sustainable Agricultural Communities(ISAC) was established in 1991 to promote organic farming (among other sustainable agricultural practices). The national target via the National Plan for Organic Farming is to attain, by 2021, 1.3\u00a0million rai (2,100 square kilometres; 800 square miles) of organically farmed land. Another target is for 40% of the produce from these farmlands to be consumed domestically.[237]\nMuch progress has been made:[238][239][237]\nTheUnited States Department of Agriculture Rural Development(USDARD) was created in 1994 as a subsection of theUSDAthat implements programs to stimulate growth in rural communities.[240]One of the programs that the USDARD created provided grants to farmers who practiced organic farming through the Organic Certification Cost Share Program (OCCSP).[241]During the 21st century, theUnited Stateshas continued to expand its reach in the organic foods market, doubling the number of organic farms in the U.S. in 2016 when compared to 2011.[242]\nEmployment on organic farms offers potentially large numbers of jobs for people, and this may better manage theFourth Industrial Revolution. Moreover, sustainable forestry, fishing, and mining, and other conservation-oriented activities provide larger numbers of jobs than more fossil fuel and mechanized work.\nAs was the case with most countries,Sri Lankamade the transition away from organic farming upon the arrival of the Green Revolution, whereupon it started depending more on chemical fertilizers. This became a highly popularized method when the nation started offering subsidies on the import of artificial fertilizers to increase rice paddy production, and to incentivize farmers to switch from growing traditional varieties into using high yielding varieties (HYVs).[245]This was especially true for young farmers who saw short-term economic profit as more sustainable to their wellbeing, compared to the long term drawbacks to the environment.[246]However, due to the various health concerns with inorganic farming including the possibility of a chronic kidney disease being associated with chemical fertilizers, many middle aged and experienced farmers displayed skepticism towards these new approaches. Some even resorted to organic farming or utilizing insecticide free fertilizers for their crops.[247]In a study conducted by F. Horgan and E. Kudavidanage, the researchers compared crop yields of farmers in Sri Lanka who employed distinct farming techniques including organic farmers who grew traditional varieties, and insecticide-free fertilizer users and pesticide users who grew modern varieties.[247]No significant difference was found among the yield productions and in fact, organic farmers and insecticide-free fertilizer users lamented less about insects such as planthoppers as a challenge to their production. Regardless, many farmers continued to use insecticides to avoid the predicted dangers of pests to their crops, and the cheap sale of agrochemicals provided an easy approach to augment crop growth. Additionally, while organic farming has health benefits, it's a strenuous task which requires more man power.[248]Although that presented a great opportunity for increased employment in Sri Lanka, the economic compensation was not enough to suffice the living expenses of those employed. Thus, most farmers relied on modern methods to run their household, especially after the economic stressors brought on by COVID-19.[249]\nHowever, while Sri Lanka was still facing the new challenges of the pandemic, in the2019 presidential electioncampaign, the president,Gotabaya Rajapaksaproposed a 10-year, national transition to organic farming to declare Sri Lanka as the first nation to be known for its organic produce.[249][250]On April 27, 2021,[251]the country issued an order prohibiting the import of any inorganic pesticides or fertilizers, creating chaos among farmers.[252][253][254]While such a change was made over concerns for the nation's ecosystems and the health of citizens where pesticide poisonings prevailed over other health related deaths,[255]the precipitous decision was met with criticism from the agriculture industry. This included fears that the mandate would harm the yields of the country's major crops (despite claims to the contrary), that the country would not be able to produce enough organic fertilizer domestically, and organic farming being more expensive and complex than conventional agriculture.[256][253][249]To put this into perspective, 7.4% of Sri Lanka's GDP is reliant on agriculture and 30% of citizens work in this sector.[257]This means that about \u2153 of its population is dependent on this sector for jobs, making its maintenance highly crucial for the prosperity of the nation's social and economic status. Of special concern wasriceandtea, which are a staple food and major export respectively.\nDespite it being a record crop in the first half of 2021, the tea crop began to decline in July of that year.[249]Rice production fell by 20% over the first six months of the ban, and prices increased by around 50%. Contrary to its past success atself-sustainability, the country had to import US$450 million worth of rice to meet domestic demand.[249]In late August, the government acknowledged the ban had created a critical dependency on supplies of imported organic fertilizers, but by then food prices had already increased twofold in some cases.[258]In September 2021, the government declared aneconomic emergency, citing the ban's impact on food prices, as well as inflation from the devaluation of Sri Lankan currency due to the crashing tea industry, and a lack of tourism induced by COVID-19 restrictions.[259][260][258]\nIn November 2021, the country partially lifted the ban on inorganic farming for certain key crops such as rubber and tea, and began to offer compensation and subsidies to farmers and rice producers in an attempt to cover losses.[261][249][262]The previous subsidies on synthetic fertilizer imports were not reintroduced.[249]\nMedia related toOrganic farmingat Wikimedia Commons", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture": "Contents\nUnited States Department of Agriculture\nOverview\nHistory\nOrigins in the Patent Office\nHistory\nNew Deal era\nModern times\nOrganization and Component Staff Level\nInactive Departmental Services\nDiscrimination\nPigford v.

It is headed by thesecretary of agriculture, who reports directly to thepresident of the United Statesand is a member of the president'sCabinet. The current secretary isTom Vilsack, who has served since February 24, 2021.[2]\nApproximately 71% of the USDA's $213\u00a0billion budget goes towards nutrition assistance programs administered by theFood and Nutrition Service(FNS). The largest component of the FNS budget is theSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program(formerly known as the 'Food Stamp' program), which is the cornerstone of USDA's nutrition assistance.[3]TheUnited States Forest Serviceis the largest agency within the department, which administersnational forestsandnational grasslandsthat together comprise about 25% offederal lands.\nThe USDA is divided into eight distinct mission areas, each of which have at least one agency dedicated to the theme of the mission area:\nFarm Production and Conservation (FPAC)\nFood, Nutrition, and Consumer Services (FNCS)\nFood Safety (FS)\nMarketing and Regulatory Programs (MRP)\nNatural Resources and the Environment (NRE)\nResearch, Education, and Economics (REE)\nRural Development (RD)\nTrade and Foreign Agriculture Affairs (TFAA)\n[4]\nMany of the programs concerned with the distribution of food and nutrition to people of theUnited Statesand providingnourishmentas well asnutrition educationto those in need are run by theFood and Nutrition Service. Activities in this program include theSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides healthy food to over 40\u00a0million low-income and homeless people each month.[5]USDA is a member of theUnited States Interagency Council on Homelessness,[6]where it is committed to working with other agencies to ensure these mainstream benefits have been accessed by those experiencing homelessness.\nThe USDA also is concerned with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both the domestic and world markets. It plays a role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries. This aid can go throughUSAID, foreign governments, international bodies such asWorld Food Program, or approved nonprofits. TheAgricultural Act of 1949, section 416 (b) andAgricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, also known asFood for Peace, provides the legal basis of such actions. The USDA is a partner of theWorld Cocoa Foundation.\nThe standard history is Gladys L. Baker, ed.,Century of Service: The first 100 years of the United States Department of Agriculture(U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1963).[7]\nEarly in its history, theAmerican economywas largelyagrarian. Officials in the federal government had long sought new and improved varieties of seeds, plants and animals for import into the United States. In 1829, by request ofJames Smithsonout of a desire to further promulgate and diffuse scientific knowledge amongst the American people, theSmithsonian Institutionwas established, though it did not incorporate agriculture.[8]In 1837,Henry Leavitt EllsworthbecameCommissioner of Patentsin theDepartment of State. He began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of theCongressand local agricultural societies. In 1839,Congressestablished the Agricultural Division within thePatent Officeand allotted $1,000 for \"the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes.\"[9]Ellsworth's interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the various new seeds and plants, a clerk to collect agricultural statistics, the preparation of statewide reports about crops in different regions, and the application of chemistry to agriculture.[10]Ellsworthwas called the \"Father of the Department of Agriculture.\"[11]\nIn 1849, thePatent Officewas transferred to the newly createdDepartment of the Interior. In the ensuing years, agitation for a separate bureau within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring.[10]\nOn May 15, 1862,Abraham Lincolnestablished the independent Department of Agriculture through theMorrill Actto be headed by a commissioner withoutCabinetstatus. Staffed by only eight employees, the department was charged with conducting research and development related to \"agriculture,rural development,aquacultureand human nutrition in the most general and comprehensive sense of those terms\".[12]AgriculturalistIsaac Newtonwas appointed to be the first commissioner.[13]Lincoln called it the \"people's department\", since over half of the nation, at the time, was directly or indirectly involved inagricultureoragribusiness.[14]\nIn 1868, the department moved into the newDepartment of Agriculture Buildingin Washington, designed by famed D.C. architectAdolf Cluss. Located on theNational Mallbetween 12th Street and 14th SW, the department had offices for its staff and the entire width of the Mall up to B Street NW to plant and experiment with plants.[15]\nIn the 1880s, varied advocacy groups were lobbying for Cabinet representation. Business interests sought aDepartment of Commerce and Industry, and farmers tried to raise the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet rank. In 1887, theHouse of RepresentativesandSenatepassed separate bills giving Cabinet status to the Department of Agriculture and Labor, but the bill was defeated inconference committeeafter farm interests objected to the addition of labor. Finally, in 1889 the Department of Agriculture was given cabinet-level status.[16]\nIn 1887, theHatch Actprovided for the federal funding ofagricultural experiment stationsin each state. TheSmith-Lever Act of 1914then fundedcooperative extension servicesin each state to teach agriculture,home economics, and other subjects to the public. With these and similar provisions, the USDA reached out to every county of every state.[17]\nBy the year 1933, the department was well established in Washington and very well known in rural America. In the agricultural field the picture was different. Statisticians created a comprehensive data-gathering arm in the Division of Crop and Livestock Estimates. Secretary Henry Wallace, a statistician, further strengthened the expertise by introducing sampling techniques. Professional economists ran a strong Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Most important was the agricultural experiment station system, a network of state partners in the land-grant colleges, which in turn operated a large field service in direct contact with farmers in practically every rural county. The department worked smoothly with a nationwide, well-organized pressure group, theAmerican Farm Bureau Federation. It represented the largest commercial growers before Congress.[18]\nAs late as theGreat Depression, farm work occupied a fourth of Americans. Indeed, many young people who moved to the cities in the prosperous 1920s returned to the family farm after the depression caused unemployment after 1929. The USDA helped ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it, assisted with loans for small landowners, and provided technical advice. ItsBureau of Home Economics, established in 1923, published shopping advice and recipes to stretch family budgets and make food go farther.[19]\nOn August 27, 2018, the USDA announced it would be providing U.S. farmers with a farm aid package totaling $4.7\u00a0billion in direct payments to American farmers. This package is meant to offset the losses farmers are expected to incur from retaliatory tariffs placed on American exports during theTrump tariffs.[20]\nOn 7 February 2022, the USDA announced the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, a $1 billion program that will test and verify the benefits of climate-friendly agricultural practices.[21]\nIn October 2022, the USDA announced a $1.3 billion debt relief program for about 36,000 farmers who had fallen behind on loan payments or facing foreclosures. The provisions in theInflation Reduction Act of 2022set aside $3.1 billion to help such farmers with high-risk operations caused by USDA-backed loans.[22]\nUSDA's offices and agencies are listed below, with full-time equivalent staff levels according to the estimated FY2023 appropriation, as reported in USDA's FY2024 Congressional Budget Justification.[1]\nSecretary of Agriculture\nDeputy Secretary of Agriculture\nUnder Secretary for Farm Production and Conservation\nUnder Secretary for Rural Development\nUnder Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services\nUnder Secretary for Food Safety\nUnder Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment\nUnder Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs\nUnder Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics\nAllegations have been made that throughout the agency's history its personnel have discriminated against farmers of various backgrounds, denying them loans and access to other programs well into the 1990s.[25]The effect of this discrimination caused a reduction in the number ofAfrican Americanfarmers in the United States.[26]ThoughAfrican Americanfarmers have been the most hit by discriminatory actions by the USDA, women,Native Americans,Hispanics, and other minorities have experienced discrimination in a variety of forms at the hands of the USDA. The majority of these discriminatory actions have occurred through theFarm Service Agency, which oversees loan and assistance programs to farmers.[27]\nIn response to theSupreme Court'sruling of unconstitutionality of theAgricultural Adjustment Act,Congressenacted theSoil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1936, which established theSoil Conservation Service(SCS) which provided service to private landowners and encouraged subsidies that would relieve soil from excessive farming. The SCS in its early days were hesitant, especially in Southern jurisdictions, to hire Black conservationists. Rather than reaching out to Black students in universities for interviews and job opportunities, students had to reach out for the few opportunities granted to Black conservationists.[28]\nAs part of the 1964Civil Rights Act, the USDA formally ended racial segregation among its staff.[29]In the 1999Pigford v. Glickmanclass-action lawsuit brought by African American farmers, the USDA agreed to a billion-dollar settlement due to its patterns of discrimination in the granting of loans and subsidies to black farmers.[29]In 2011, a second round of payouts,Pigford II,was appropriated by Congress for $1.25 billion, although this payout, far too late to support the many who desperately needed financial assistance during 1999 lawsuit, only comes out to around $250,000 per farmer.[30]\nA March 17, 2006 letter from the GAO about the Pigford Settlement indicated that \"the court noted that USDA disbanded its Office of Civil Rights in 1983, and stopped responding to claims of discrimination.\"[31]\nFollowing long-standing concerns, black farmers joined aclass actiondiscrimination suit against the USDA filed in federal court in 1997.[32]An attorney called it \"the most organized, largest civil rights case in the history of the country.\"[33]Also in 1997, black farmers from at least five states held protests in front of the USDA headquarters inWashington, D.C.[34]Protests in front of the USDA were a strategy employed in later years as the black farmers sought to keep national attention focused on the plight of the black farmers. Representatives of theNational Black Farmers Associationmet with PresidentBill Clintonand other administration officials at theWhite House. And NBFA's president testified before theUnited States House Committee on Agriculture.[35]\nInPigford v. Glickman, U.S. Federal District Court JudgePaul L. Friedmanapproved the settlement and consent decree on April 14, 1999.[32]The settlement recognized discrimination against 22,363 black farmers, but the NBFA would later call the agreement incomplete because more than 70,000 were excluded.[36]Nevertheless, the settlement was deemed to be the largest-ever civil rights class action settlement in American history. Lawyers estimated the value of the settlement to be more than $2\u00a0billion.[37]Some farmers would have their debts forgiven.[38]Judge Friedman appointed a monitor to oversee the settlement.[37]Farmers in Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Georgia were among those affected by the settlement.[39]\nThe NBFA's president was invited to testify before congress on this matter numerous times following the settlement, including before theUnited States Senate Committee on Agricultureon September 12, 2000, when he testified that many farmers had not yet received payments and others were left out of the settlement. It was later revealed that one DoJ staff \"general attorney\" was unlicensed while she was handling black farmers' cases.[40]NBFA called for all those cases to be reheard.[41]TheChicago Tribunereported in 2004 that the result of such longstanding USDA discrimination was that black farmers had been forced out of business at a rate three times faster than white farmers. In 1920, 1 in 7 U.S. farmers was African-American, and by 2004 the number was 1 in 100. USDA spokesman Ed Loyd, when acknowledging that the USDA loan process was unfair to minority farmers, had claimed it was hard to determine the effect on such farmers.[42]\nIn 2006 theGovernment Accountability Office(GAO) issued a report highly critical of the USDA in its handling of the black farmers cases.[43]NBFA continued to lobby Congress to provide relief. NBFA'sJohn Boyd (farmer)secured congressional support for legislation that would provide $100\u00a0million in funds to settle late-filer cases. In 2006 a bill was introduced into the House of Representatives and later the Senate by SenatorGeorge Felix Allen.[44]In 2007 Boyd testified before theUnited States House Committee on the Judiciaryabout this legislation.[41]As the organization was making headway by gathering Congressional supporters in 2007 it was revealed that some USDA Farm Services Agency employees were engaged in activities aimed at blocking Congressional legislation that would aid the black farmers.[45]Barack Obama, then a U.S. Senator, lent his support to the black farmers' issues in 2007.[46]A bill co-sponsored by Obama passed the Senate in 2007.[47]\nIn early June 2008 hundreds of black farmers, denied a chance to have their cases heard in thePigfordsettlement, filed a new lawsuit against USDA.[48]The Senate and House versions of the black farmers bill, reopening black farmers discrimination cases, became law in June 2008.[49]Some news reports said that the new law could affect up to 74,000 black farmers.[50]In October 2008, the GAO issued a report criticizing the USDA's handling of discrimination complaints.[51]The GAO recommended an oversight review board to examine civil rights complaints.[52]\nAfter numerous public rallies and an intensive NBFA member lobbying effort, Congress approved and Obama signed into law in December 2010 legislation that set aside $1.15\u00a0billion to resolve the outstanding black farmers' cases. NBFA's John W. Boyd Jr., attended the bill-signing ceremony at the White House.[41]As of 2013, 90,000 African-American, Hispanic, female and Native American farmers had filed claims. It was reported that some had been found fraudulent, or transparently bogus. InMaple Hill, North Carolina by 2013, the number of successful claimants was four times the number of farms with 1 out of 9 African-Americans being paid, while \"claimants were not required [by the USDA] to present documentary evidence that they had been unfairly treated or had even tried to farm.\" Lack of documentation is an issue complicated by the USDA practice of discarding denied applications after three years.[53]\nIn 1999,Native American farmers, discriminated in a similar fashion to black farmers, filed aclass-actionlawsuit against the USDA allegingloan discriminationunder theECOAand theAPA. This case relied heavily on its predecessor,Pigford v. Glickman, in terms of the reasoning it set forth in the lawsuit.[27]Eventually, a settlement was reached between the plaintiffs and the USDA to the amount of up to $760 million, awardable through individualdamagesclaims.[54]These claims could be used for monetary relief, debt relief, and/or tax relief. The filing period began June 29, 2011 and lasted 180 days.[55]Track A claimants would be eligible for up to $50,000, whereas Track B claimants would be eligible for up to $250,000 with a higher standard of proof.[55]\nIn 2000, similar toPigford v. Glickman, aclass-actionlawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of Hispanic farmers alleging that the USDA discriminated against them in terms of credit transactions and disaster benefits, in direct violation ofECOA. As per the settlement, $1.33 billion is available for compensation in awards of up to $50,000 or $250,000, while an additional $160 million is available indebt relief.[27]\nIn 2001, similar toGarcia v. Vilsack, aclass-actionlawsuit was filed in the same court allegingdiscriminationon the basis of gender. A Congressional response to the lawsuit resulted in the passing of theEquality for Women Farmers Act, which created a system that would allow for allegations of gender discrimination to be heard against the USDA and enable claims for damages.[27]\nIn their 2012environmental justicestrategy, theU.S. Department of Agriculture(USDA) stated an ongoing desire to integrate environmental justice into its core mission and operations. In 2011,Secretary of AgricultureTom Vilsackemphasized the USDA's focus onEJin rural communities around the United States, as well as connecting withIndigenous Tribesand ensuring they understand and receive their environmental rights. USDA does fund programs with social and environmental equity goals; however, it has no staff dedicated solely to EJ.\nOn February 16, 1994,President ClintonissuedExecutive Order 12898, \"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations.\"Executive Order 12898requires that achieving EJ must be part of each federal agency's mission. UnderExecutive Order 12898federal agencies must:\nThe Executive Order also created an Interagency Working Group (IWG) consisting of 11 heads of departments and agencies.[56]\nOn February 7, 2012, the USDA released a final Environmental Justice Strategic Plan identifying new and updated goals and performance measures beyond what USDA identified in a 1995 EJ strategy that was adopted in response to E.O. 12898.[57]Generally, USDA believes its existing technical and financial assistance programs provide solutions to environmental inequity, such as its initiatives on education,food deserts, and economic development in impacted communities.\nNatural Resources and Environment Under Secretary Harris Sherman is the political appointee generally responsible for USDA's EJ strategy, with Patrick Holmes, a senior staffer to the Under Secretary, playing a coordinating role. USDA has no staff dedicated solely to EJ.[58]\nUSDA has had a role in implementingMichelle Obama'sLet's Movecampaign in tribal areas by increasingBureau of Indian Educationschools' participation in federal nutrition programs, by developing community gardens on tribal lands, and developing tribal food policy councils.[59]\nMore than $6.2 billion inRural Developmentfunding has been allocated for community infrastructure inIndian countryand is distributed via 47 state offices that altogether cover the entire continentalUnited States,Hawaii, andAlaska.[58]Such funding has been used for a variety of reasons:\nIn 1997, theU.S. Forest Service(USFS) published a resource guide aimed at helping USFS officials with developing and maintaining relations with different tribal governments. To that end, and in coordination with the Forest Service's 4*pointAmerican Indian/Alaska Nativepolicy, the resource guide discusses how to:\nThe USFS works to maintain good governmental relationships through regular intergovernmental meetings, acknowledgement of pre*existing tribal sovereignty, and a better general understanding of tribal government, which varies from tribe to tribe. Indian treaty rights and trust responsibilities are honored through visits to tribal neighbors, discussions of mutual interest, and attempts to honor and accommodate the legal positions of Indians and the federal government. Addressing and demonstrating sensitivity to Native religious beliefs and practices includes walking through Native lands and acknowledging cultural needs when implementing USFS activities. Providing research, technology, and assistance to Indian governments is shown through collaboration of ecological studies and sharing of various environmental technologies, as well as the inclusion of traditional Native practices in contemporary operations of the USFS.[61]\nThe Intertribal Technical Assistance Network works to improve access of tribal governments, communities and individuals to USDA technical assistance programs.[62]\nThe Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service provides APHIS Veterinary Services, which serve the tribal community by promoting and fostering safe animal trade and care. This includes prevention of pests and disease from herd and fisheries as well as surveys for diseases on or near Native American lands that can affect traditionally hunted wildlife.[63][full citation needed]The APHIS also provides Wildlife Services, which help with wildlife damage on Native lands. This includes emergency trainings, outreach, consultation, internship opportunities for students, and general education on damage reduction, livestock protection, and disease monitoring.[64][full citation needed]\nMeanwhile, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is exploring a program to use meat from bisons raised on tribal land to supply AMS food distribution programs to tribes.[58]\nThe NRCS Strike Force Initiative has identified impoverished counties in Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas to receive increased outreach and training regarding USDA assistance programs. USDA credits this increased outreach with generating a 196 percent increase in contracts, representing more than 250,000 acres of farmland, in its Environmental Quality Incentives Program.[62]In 2001, NRCS funded and published a study, \"Environmental Justice: Perceptions of Issues, Awareness and Assistance,\" focused on rural, Southern \"Black Belt\" counties and analyzing how the NRCS workforce could more effectively integrate environmental justice into impacted communities.[65]\nTheFarm Services Agencyin 2011 devoted $100,000 of its Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers program budget to improving its outreach to counties with persistent poverty.[66]USDA's Risk Management Agency has initiated education and outreach to low-income farmers regarding use of biological controls, rather than pesticides, for pest control.[58]The Rural Utilities Service administers water and wastewater loans, includingSEARCH Grantsthat are targeted to financially distressed, small rural communities and other opportunities specifically for Alaskan Native villages.[67][68]\nUSFS has established several Urban Field Stations, to research urban natural resources' structure, function, stewardship, and benefits.[69]By mapping urban tree coverage, the agency hopes to identify and prioritize EJ communities for urban forest projects.[69]\nAnother initiative highlighted by the agency is the Food and Nutrition Service and Economic Research Service's Food Desert Locator.[70]The Locator provides a spatial view of food deserts, defined as a low-income census tract where a substantial number or share of residents has low access to a supermarket or large grocery store. The mapped deserts can be used to direct agency resources to increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables and other food assistance programs.[71]\nTheUSDA Meat and Poultry hotlineis a toll-freeuser assistancehotlinefor consumers to answer inquiries about the safe storage, handling, and preparation of meat, poultry, and egg products that can be reached at 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854).[72][73]The Hotline also responds to other issues related to the mission of USDA'sFood Safety and Inspection Service(FSIS), which is to ensure that commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged.[72]The hotline operates year-round on weekdays excluding federal holidays (except Thanksgiving) from 10 AM to 6 PM PT. Food safety specialists with home economics, nutrition, and food technology backgrounds staff it.[74]The hotline began on July 1, 1985, and has answered over 2 million calls to date in 2024.[74]The hotline added Spanish support in 2002 and added two hours in April 2017.[74][75]The hotline can help detect public health threats and has been attributed with increasing American's awareness of foodborne bacteria and how to avoid them.[76][77]\nThe USDA also offers online text support via \"Ask Karen.\"[75]\nPart of the USDA's functions includes promoting the economic development of the agricultural sector. In their 2022 strategic plan, they pledged:\nTo maintain a competitive agricultural sector, USDA will support farmers and ranchers\u2019 ability to start and maintain profitable businesses as well as offer financial support to producers affected by natural disasters. Furthermore, USDA\u2019s research agencies will continue to introduce high-performance plants, animals, and integrated management options that increase the efficiency of farming practices. Lastly, USDA will also provide tools to producers so that they are well-positioned to secure a share of a growing market for agricultural products.[78][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\nThe USDA formalized a relationship with theGlobal Food Safety Initiative(GFSI) in 2018.  GFSI is a private organization where members of theConsumer Goods Forumhave control over benchmarking requirements in recognition ofprivate standardsfor food safety. In August 2018, USDA achieved Technical Equivalence against Version 7.1 of the GFSI Benchmarking Requirements for their HarmonizedGAPPlus + certification programme,[79]where Technical Equivalence is limited to government-owned food safety certification programmes. This is misaligned with U.S. Government Policy andOMB Circular No. A-119[80]which instructs its agencies to adoptvoluntary consensus standardsbefore relying uponindustry standards(private standards) or developing government standards.\nHarmonizedGAPPlus+ Standard (V. 3.0) was published in February 2021[81]with reference to GFSI Guidance Document Version 2020, Part III, ignoring reference tointernational standardsand technical specificationsISO 22000and ISO T/S 22002-3 Prerequisite Programmes for Farming. TheUSDAexception toOMB Circular No. A-119might be attributed tolobbyingand influence ofConsumer Goods Forummembers in Washington, D.C.[82]In November 2021, GFSI announced its Technical Equivalence was under strategic review explaining the assessment has raised concerns across many stakeholders.[83]\nThe USDA monitors American dairy production and markets, for which it has a Dairy Board and a marketing branch known asDairy Management Incorporated(DMI).[84]Furthermore, the USDA collaborates with United Dairy Industry Association (UDIA), the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board for market information on the industry.[85]\nDuring theCOVID-19 pandemic, Congress allocated funding to the USDA to address the disturbances rippling through the agricultural sector. On April 17, 2020, U.S. Secretary of AgricultureSonny Perdueannounced the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program:[86]\nThe American food supply chain had to adapt, and it remains safe, secure, and strong, and we all know that starts with America's farmers and ranchers. This program will not only provide immediate relief for our farmers and ranchers, but it will also allow for the purchase and distribution of our agricultural abundance to help our fellow Americans in need.\nThis provided $16\u00a0billion for farmers and ranchers, and $3\u00a0billion to purchase surplus produce, dairy, and meat from farmers for distribution to charitable organizations.[87]As part of theCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act(CARES) and theFamilies First Coronavirus Response Act(FFCRA), USDA has up to an additional $873.3\u00a0million available in Section 32 funding to purchase a variety of agricultural products for distribution to food banks, $850\u00a0million for food bank administrative costs and USDA food purchases.[87]\nImportant legislation setting policy of the USDA includes the:[88]", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_productivity": "Contents\nAgricultural productivity\nSources of agricultural productivity\nImpact\nFood security\nRelation to population growth\nInverse relationship theory\nSustainable increases in productivity\nSee also\nReferences\nCitations\nCited sources\nExternal links\nAgricultural productivityis measured as the ratio ofagriculturaloutputs to inputs.[1]While individual products are usually measured by weight, which is known ascrop yield, varying products make measuring overall agricultural output difficult. Therefore, agricultural productivity is usually measured as themarket valueof the final output. This productivity can be compared to many different types of inputs such as labour or land. Such comparisons are called partial measures of productivity.[2]\nAgricultural productivity may also be measured by what is termedtotal factor productivity(TFP). This method of calculating agricultural productivity compares an index of agricultural inputs to an index of outputs. This measure of agricultural productivity was established to remedy the shortcomings of the partial measures of productivity; notably that it is often hard to identify the factors cause them to change. Changes in TFP are usually attributed to technological improvements.[3]\nAgricultural productivity is an important component offood security.[4]Increasing agricultural productivity throughsustainable practicescan be an important way to decrease the amount of land needed for farming and slowenvironmental degradationandclimate changethrough processes likedeforestation.[5]\nProductivity is driven by changes in either agricultural technique or improvements in technology. Some sources of changes in agricultural productivity have included:[7]\nSee:Productivity improving technologies (historical)Section: 2.4.1: Mechanization: Agriculture, Section 2.6: Scientific agriculture.\nThe productivity of a region'sfarmsis important for many reasons. Aside from providing morefood, increasing the productivity of farms affects the region's prospects for growth and competitiveness on the agricultural market,income distributionand savings, and labour migration. An increase in a region's agricultural productivity implies a moreefficientdistribution of scarce resources. As farmers adopt new techniques and differences, the more productive farmers benefit from an increase in their welfare while farmers who are not productive enough will exit the market to seek success elsewhere.[10]\nAs a region's farms become more productive, itscomparative advantagein agricultural products increases, which means that it can produce these products at a loweropportunity costthan can other regions.[11]Therefore, the region becomes more competitive on the world market, which means that it can attract moreconsumerssince they are able to buy more of the products offered for the same amount of money. As productivity improvement leads to falling food prices, this automatically leads to increases inreal incomeelsewhere.[12]\nIncreases in agricultural productivity lead also to agricultural growth and can help to alleviatepovertyin poor anddeveloping countries, where agriculture often employs the greatest portion of the population. As farms become more productive, the wages earned by those who work in agriculture increase. At the same time,food pricesdecrease and food supplies become more stable. Labourers therefore have more money to spend on food as well as other products. This also leads to agricultural growth. People see that there is a greater opportunity to earn their living by farming and are attracted to agriculture either as owners of farms themselves or as labourers.[13]\nIt is not only the people employed in agriculture who benefit from increases in agricultural productivity. Those employed in other sectors also enjoy lower food prices and a more stable food supply. Their wages may also increase.[13]\nAgricultural productivity is becoming increasingly important as theworld populationcontinues to grow.[14]As agricultural productivity grows, food prices decrease, allowing people to spend less on food, and combatting hunger.[15]India, one of the world's most populous countries, has taken steps in the past decades to increase its land productivity. In the 1960sNorth Indiaproduced onlywheat, but with the advent of the earlier maturing high-yielding wheats andrices, the wheat could be harvested in time to plant rice. This wheat/rice combination is now widely used throughout thePunjab,Haryana, and parts ofUttar Pradesh. The wheat yield of three tons and rice yield of two tons combine for five tons of grain perhectare, helping to feed India's 1.1 billion people.[14]\nHigher global food prices between 2006 and 2008, primarily caused by an increasing amountarable landused for growingbiofuelsand the growing economies in China and elsewhere causing an increase in demand for meat products (which are less efficient than plants in terms of land use), caused the percentage of incomes used for food to increase throughout the world, forcing families to cut back on various other expenditures such as schooling for girls. In areas of sub-Saharan Africa, a decreased agricultural productivity due to crop failures has caused starvation.[15]On the other hand, higher global prices actually mean farmers with successful yields earn more, and this thus increases their productivity.[16]\nInvesting in the agricultural productivity of women in farming communities is of particular importance in boostingeconomic developmentand food security in parts of thedeveloping world. Women in some areas of the world, for example in Africa, traditionally have less agency than men, but are often also more invested in farming in terms of time spent. They are furthermore generally more responsible for childcare, thus their productivity is more likely to translate in gains for the family as a whole.[15]\nSome critics claim that increasing agricultural productivity results inhuman overpopulation. They are argue that, like other species, human populations grow up to theircarrying capacity. When a species reaches its carrying capacity, the number ofpoor and weak individualswho die from disease or starvation is equal to the number of individuals being added to the population via birth. Because innovation continues to improve agricultural productivity (specifically yields), however, the theoretical carrying capacity continues to increase, allowing the human population to continue to grow. These writers claim that there are too many people on Earth and that therefore growth in agricultural productivity is detrimental to theenvironment\u2014 if the carrying capacity was lower, the human population would reach an equilibrium at a lower number.[17][18]\nHowever, unlike other animals, in humans greater development and prosperity has led to lower fecundity. Thus as productivity has increased and poverty has been reduced worldwide, population growth is declining. Research suggests we may actually face a declining world population in the future.[19][20]\nDeolalikar in 1981 investigated the theory first proposed by Sen in 1975 that in traditional, pre-modern farming inIndia, there is an inverse relationship to size of the farm and productivity, contrary to theeconomy of scalefound in all other types of economic activity. It is debated whether the inverse relationship actually exists. Numerous studies falsify this theory.[21]InZimbabwe, policies onagrarian land reformunder presidentRobert Mugabe, especially in and following 2000, split large farms into many smaller farms, and this decreased productivity.Marxist agrarian land reformin theSoviet Union,ChinaandVietnamcombined small farms into larger units, this usually failed to increase productivity.[22]\nNonetheless, increasing agricultural productivity amongstsmallholderfarms is an important way to improve farmer livelihoods in thedeveloping world.[5]\nBecauseagriculture has such significant impacts on climate changeand otherenvironmental issues,intensificationof agriculture, which would increase productivity per amount of land being farmed, is seen by some as an essential method forclimate change mitigation, because farmers will not require more land, and are thus incentivized not to participate in furtherland degradationordeforestation.[5]Implementing intensification throughsustainable agriculturepractices makes farming more sustainable in the long term, maintaining the ability of future generations to meet their own needs while conserving the environment. International policy, embodied inSustainable Development Goal 2, focuses on improving these practices at a global level.[23]\nNot alleffects of climate changewill negatively affect agricultural productivity. The IPCCSpecial Report on Climate Change and Landand theSpecial Report on Global Warming of 1.5 \u00b0Cboth project mixed changes in the yields of crops asglobal warminghappens with somebreadbasketregions becoming less productive, while other crops increase ranges and productivity.[24]\n", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_agriculture": "Glossary of agriculture\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nU\nV\nW\nX\nY\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nThisglossary of agricultureis a list of definitions of terms and concepts used inagriculture, its sub-disciplines, and related fields, includinghorticulture,animal husbandry,agribusiness, andagricultural policy.

The eastern wetter half is a major corn and soybean-producing region known as theCorn Belt, and the western drier half is known as theWheat Beltbecause of its high rate of wheat production.[3]TheCentral Valley of Californiaproducesfruits,vegetables, andnuts. TheAmerican Southhas historically been a large producer ofcotton,tobacco, andrice, but it has declined in agricultural production over the past century.Floridaleads the nation in citrus production and is the number two producer of oranges in the world behind onlyBrazil.\nThe U.S. has led developments in seed improvement, such ashybridization, and in expanding uses for crops from the work ofGeorge Washington Carvertobioplasticsandbiofuels. Themechanization of farmingandintensive farminghave been major themes inU.S. history, includingJohn Deere's steel plow,Cyrus McCormick'smechanical reaper,Eli Whitney'scotton gin, and the widespread success of theFordsontractor and thecombine harvester. Modern agriculture in the U.S. ranges fromhobby farmsand small-scale producers to largecommercial farmsthat cover thousands of acres of cropland orrangeland.\nCorn,turkeys,tomatoes,potatoes,peanuts, andsunflower seedsconstitute some of the major holdovers from theagricultural endowment of the Americas.\nColonists had more access to land in the colonial United States than they did in Europe. The organization of labor was complex including free persons, slaves and indentured servants depending on the regions where either slaves or poor landless laborers were available to work on family farms.[4]\nEuropean agricultural practices greatly affected theNew Englandlandscape. Colonists brought livestock over from Europe which caused many changes to the land. Grazing animals required a lot of land and food and the act of grazing itself destroyed native grasses, which were being replaced by European species. New species of weeds were introduced and began to thrive as they were capable of withstanding the grazing of animals, whereas native species could not.[5]\nThe practices associated with keeping livestock also contributed to the deterioration of the forests and fields. Colonists would cut down the trees and then allow their cattle and livestock to graze freely in the forest and never plant more trees. The animals trampled and tore up the ground so much as to cause long-term destruction and damage.[5]\nSoil exhaustionwas a huge problem in New England agriculture. Farming with oxen did allow the colonist to farm more land but it increased erosion and decreasedsoil fertility. This was due to deeper plow cuts in the soil that allowed the soil more contact with oxygen causingnutrient depletion. In grazing fields in New England, the soil was being compacted by the large number of cattle and this did not give the soil enough oxygen to sustain life.[5]\nIn the United States, farms spread from the colonies westward along with the settlers. In cooler regions,wheatwas often the crop of choice when lands were newly settled, leading to a \"wheat frontier\" that moved westward over the course of years. Also very common in the antebellumMidwestwas farmingcornwhile raisinghogs, complementing each other especially since it was difficult to get grain to market before the canals and railroads. After the \"wheat frontier\" had passed through an area, more diversified farms includingdairy cattlegenerally took its place. Warmer regions saw plantings ofcottonand herds ofbeef cattle. In the early colonial South, raisingtobaccoand cotton was common, especially through the use of slave labor until theCivil War. With an established source for labor, and the development of thecotton ginin 1793, the South was able to maintain an economy based on the production of cotton. By the late 1850s, the South produced one-hundred percent of the 374 million pounds of cotton used in the United States. The rapid growth in cotton production was possible because of the availability of slaves.[6]In the northeast, slaves were used in agriculture until the early 19th century.[7]In the Midwest, slavery was prohibited by theFreedom Ordinance of 1787.\nThe introduction and broad adoption of scientific agriculture since the mid-19th century contributed to economic growth in the United States. This development was facilitated by theMorrill Actand theHatch Act of 1887which established in each state aland-grant university(with a mission to teach and study agriculture) and a federally funded system ofagricultural experiment stationsandcooperative extensionnetworks which placeextension agentsin each state.\nSoybeanswere not widely cultivated in the United States until the early 1930s, and by 1942 it became the world's largest soybean producer, due in part to World War II and the \"need for domestic sources of fats, oils, and meal\". Between 1930 and 1942, the United States' share of world soybean production grew from 3% to 47%, and by 1969 it had risen to 76%. By 1973 soybeans were the United States' \"number onecash crop, and leading export commodity, ahead of both wheat and corn\".[8]Although soybeans developed as the topcash crop,cornalso remains as an important commodity. As the basis for \"industrial food,\" corn is found in most modern day items at the grocery store. Aside from items like candy and soda, which containhigh fructose corn-syrup, corn is also found in non-edible items like the shining wax on store advertisements.[9]\nSignificant areas of farmland were abandoned during theGreat Depressionand incorporated into nascentnational forests. Later, \"Sodbuster\" and \"Swampbuster\" restrictions written into federal farm programs starting in the 1970s reversed a decades-long trend ofhabitat destructionthat began in 1942 when farmers were encouraged to plant all possible land in support of the war effort. In the United States, federal programs administered through localSoil and Water Conservation Districtsprovidetechnical assistanceand partial funding to farmers who wish to implement management practices to conserve soil and limit erosion and floods.[10]\nFarmers in the early United States were open to planting new crops, raising new animals and adopting new innovations as increased agricultural productivity in turn increased the demand for shipping services, containers, credit, storage, and the like.[11]\nAlthough four million farms disappeared in the United States between 1948 and 2015, total output from the farms that remained more than doubled. The number of farms with more than 2,000 acres (810\u00a0ha) almost doubled between 1987 and 2012, while the number of farms with 200 acres (81\u00a0ha) to 999 acres (404\u00a0ha) fell over the same period by 44%.[12]\nFarm productivity increased in the United States from the mid-20th century until the late-20th century when productivity began to stall.[13]\nFrom 1986 to 2018 about 30 million acres of cropland were abandoned.[14]\n(000 tons)\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, such asmelon(872),pumpkin(683),grapefruit(558),cranberry(404),cherry(312),blueberry(255),rye(214),olive(138), and others.[16]\nTonnesof United States agriculture production, as reported by theFood and Agriculture Organization(FAO) of the U.N. in 2003 and 2013 (ranked roughly in order of value):[17]\nOther crops appearing in the top 20 at some point in the last 40 years were:tobacco,barley, andoats, and, rarely:peanuts,almonds, andsunflower seeds.Alfalfaandhaywould both be in the top ten in 2003 if they were tracked by FAO.\nNote alfalfa and hay are not tracked by the FAO and the production of tobacco in the United States has fallen 60% between 1997 and 2003.\nHeavily mechanized, U.S. agriculture has a high yield relative to other countries. As of 2004:[20]\nThe major livestock industries in the United States:\nGoats,horses,turkeysandbeesare also raised, though in lesser quantities. Inventory data is not as readily available as for the major industries. For the three major goat-producing states\u2014Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas\u2014there were 1.2 million goats at the end of 2002. There were 5.3 million horses in the United States at the end of 1998. There were 2.5 million colonies of bees at the end of 2005.\nFarm type is based on which commodities are the majority crops grown on a farm. Nine common types include:[24][25][26]\nOne characteristic of theagriculturalindustry that sets it apart from others is the number of individuals who areself-employed. Frequently,farmersandranchersare both the principal operator, the individual responsible for successful management and day-to-day decisions, and the primary laborer for his or her operation. For agricultural workers that sustain an injury, the resultant loss of work has implications on physical health and financial stability.[27]\nThe United States has over 14,000certified organicfarms, covering more than 5 million acres, though this is less than 1% of total US farmland. The output of these farms has grown substantially since 2011, and exceeded US$7.5 billion in 2016.[28]\nAgriculture in the United States is primarily governed by periodically renewedU.S. farm bills. Governance is both a federal and a local responsibility with theUnited States Department of Agriculturebeing the federal department responsible. Government aid includes research into crop types and regional suitability as well as many kinds of federal government subsidies, price supports and loan programs. U.S. farmers are not subject toproduction quotasand some laws are different for farms compared to other workplaces.[29][30][31]\nLabor laws prohibiting children in other workplaces provide some exemptions for children working on farms with complete exemptions for children working on their family's farm.[32]Children can also gain permits from vocational training schools or4-Hclubs which allow them to do jobs they would otherwise not be permitted to do.\nA large part of the U.S. farm workforce is made up of migrant and seasonal workers, many of them recent immigrants from Latin America. Additional laws apply to these workers and their housing which is often provided by the farmer.\nFarmworkersin theUnited Stateshave unique demographics, wages, working conditions, organizing, and environmental aspects. According to The National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health in Agricultural Safety, approximately 2,112,626 full-time workers were employed in production agriculture in the US in 2019 and approximately 1.4 to 2.1 million hired crop workers are employed annually on crop farms in the US.[33]A study by the USDA found the average age of a farmworker to be 33. In 2017, the Department of Labor and Statistics found the median wage to be $23,730 a year, or $11.42 per hour.\nThe types of farmworkers include field crop workers, nursery workers, greenhouse workers, supervisors, etc.[34]The United States Department of Labor findings for the years 2019-2020 report that 63 percent of crop workers were born in Mexico, 30 percent in the mainland United States or Puerto Rico, 5 percent in Central America, and 2 percent in other regions.[35]The amount of farm labor in the United States has changed substantially: in 1870, almost 50 percent of the U.S. population was employed in agriculture;[36]As of 2008[update], less than 2 percent of the population is directly employed in agriculture.[37][38]\nAgriculture ranks among the most hazardous industries due to the use of chemicals and risk of injury.[41][42]Farmers are at high risk for fatal and nonfatal injuries (generaltraumatic injuryandmusculoskeletal injury), work-related lung diseases,noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, chemical-related illnesses, and certain cancers associated with chemical use and prolonged sun exposure.[42][43][44]In an average year, 516 workers die doing farm work in the U.S. (1992\u20132005). Every day, about 243 agricultural workers suffer lost-work-time injuries, and about 5% of these result in permanent impairment.[45]Tractor overturns are the leading cause of agriculture-related fatal injuries, and account for over 90 deaths every year. TheNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Healthrecommends the use ofroll over protection structureson tractors to reduce the risk of overturn-related fatal injuries.[45]\nFarming is one of the few industries in which families (who often share the work and live on the premises) are also at risk for injuries, illness, and death. Agriculture is the most dangerous industry for young workers, accounting for 42% of all work-related fatalities of young workers in the U.S. between 1992 and 2000. In 2011, 108 youth, less than 20 years of age, died from farm-related injuries.[46]Unlike other industries, half the young victims in agriculture were under age 15.[47]For young agricultural workers aged 15\u201317, the risk of fatal injury is four times the risk for young workers in other workplaces[48]Agricultural work exposes young workers to safety hazards such as machinery, confined spaces, work at elevations, and work around livestock. The most common causes of fatal farm-related youth injuries involve machinery, motor vehicles, or drowning. Together these three causes comprise more than half of all fatal injuries to youth on U.S. farms.[49]Women in agriculture (including the related industries offorestryandfishing) numbered 556,000 in 2011.[42]Agriculture in the U.S. makes up approximately 75% of thecountry's pesticide use. Agricultural workers are at high risk for being exposed to dangerous levels of pesticides, whether or not they are directly working with the chemicals.[44]For example, with issues likepesticide drift, farmworkers are not the only ones exposed to these chemicals; nearby residents come into contact with the pesticides as well.[50]The frequent exposure to these pesticides can have detrimental effects on humans, resulting in adverse health reactions associated withpesticide poisoning.[51][52]Migrant workers, especially women, are at higher risk for health issues associated with pesticide exposure due to lack of training or appropriate safety precautions.[53][54]United States agricultural workers experience 10,000 cases or more of physician-diagnosedpesticide poisoningannually.[55]\nFarmers' suicides in the United Statesrefers to the instances of Americanfarmerstaking their own lives, largely since the 1980s, partly due to their falling intodebt, but as a largermental-health crisis among U.S. agriculture workers. Inthe Midwestalone, over 1,500 farmers have taken their own lives since the 1980s. It mirrors a crisis happening globally: in Australia, a farmer dies by suicide every four days; in the United Kingdom, one farmer a week takes their own life, in France it is one every two days.More than 270,000farmers have died by suicide since 1995 in India.[57][58]\nFarmers are among the most likely to die by suicide, in comparison to other occupations, according to a study published in January 2020 by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC).[59]Researchers at theUniversity of Iowafound that farmers, and others in the agricultural trade, had the highest suicide rate of all occupations from 1992 to 2010, the years covered in a 2017 study.[59]The rate was 3.5 times that of the general population.[59]This echoed a study conducted the previous year by the CDC[60]and another undertaken by theNational Rural Health Association(NRHA).[61]\nMost family farmers seem to agree on what led to their plight:government policy. In the years after theNew Deal, they say, the United States set a price floor for farmers, essentially ensuring they received a minimum wage for the crops they produced. But the government began rolling back this policy in the 1970s, and now the global market largely determines the price they get for their crops. Big farms can make do with lower prices for crops by increasing their scale; a few cents per gallon of cow's milk adds up if you have thousands of cows.\u2014Time, November 27, 2019\nClimate change and agriculture are complexly related processes. In theUnited States, agriculture is the second largest emitter ofgreenhouse gases(GHG), behind the energy sector.[62]Direct GHG emissions from the agricultural sector account for 8.4% of total U.S. emissions, but the loss ofsoil organic carbonthrough soil erosion indirectly contributes to emissions as well.[63]While agriculture plays a role in propelling climate change, it is also affected by the direct (increase in temperature, change in rainfall, flooding, drought) and secondary (weed, pest, disease pressure, infrastructure damage) consequences of climate change.[62][64]USDAresearch indicates that these climatic changes will lead to a decline in yield and nutrient density in key crops, as well as decreased livestock productivity.[65][66]Climate change poses unprecedented challenges to U.S. agriculture due to the sensitivity of agricultural productivity and costs to changing climate conditions.[67]Rural communities dependent on agriculture are particularlyvulnerable to climate changethreats.[64]\nTheUS Global Change Research Program(2017) identified four key areas of concern in the agriculture sector: reduced productivity, degradation of resources, health challenges for people and livestock, and the adaptive capacity of agriculture communities.[64]\nThe number of women working in agriculture has risen and the 2002 census of agriculture recorded a 40% increase in the number of female farm workers.[69]Inequality and respect are common issues for these workers, as many have reported that they are not being respected, listened to, or taken seriously due to traditional views of women as housewives and caretakers.[70]\nWomen may also face resistance when attempting to advance to higher positions. Other issues reported by female farm workers include receiving less pay than their male counterparts and a refusal or reluctance by their employers to offer their female workers the same additional benefits given to male workers such as housing.[71]\nAs of 2012, there were 44,629 African-American farmers in the United States. The vast majority of  African-American farmers were in southern states.[72]\nHistorically, farmland has been owned by small property owners, but as of 2017 institutional investors, including foreign corporations, had been purchasing farmland.[73]In 2013 the largest producer of pork,Smithfield Foods, was bought by a company from China.[73]\nAs of 2017, only about 4% of farms have sales over $1m, but these farms yield two-thirds of total output.[74]Some of these are large farms have grown organically from private family-owned businesses.[74]\nAs of 2019, six states\u2014Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Dakota, and Oklahoma\u2014have laws banning foreign ownership of farmland. Missouri, Ohio, and Oklahoma are looking to introduce bills banning foreign ownership as of 2019.[75][76]", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization": "Contents\nFood and Agriculture Organization\nHistory\nStructure and finance\nBudget\nDirectors-General\nDeputy Directors-General\nOffices\nFAO Headquarters\nRegional Offices\nSub-regional Offices\nLiaison Offices\nPartnership and Liaison Offices\nPriority work areas\nProgrammes and achievements\nFood\nCodex Alimentarius\nWorld Food Summit\nTeleFood\nFAO Goodwill Ambassadors\nRight to Food Guidelines\nResponse to food crisis\nFAO\u2013EU partnership\nFood security programmes\nOnline campaign against hunger\nAgriculture\nInternational Plant Protection Convention\nPlant Treaty (ITPGRFA)\nAlliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition\nIntegrated pest management\nTrans-boundary pests and diseases\nGlobal Partnership Initiative for Plant Breeding Capacity Building\nInvestment in agriculture\nGlobally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS)\nCommission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA)\nAnimal Genetic Resources\nForestry\nTree Cities of the World\nFisheries\nStatistics\nMembership\nCriticism\n1970s, 80s, 90s\n2000s\n2010s\n2020s\nFAO renewal\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\nTheFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations[note 1](FAO) is aspecialized agencyof theUnited Nationsthat leads international efforts to defeathungerand improve nutrition andfood security.

Its headquarters is inRome, Italy, and it maintains regional and field offices worldwide, operating in over 130 countries.[3]It helps governments and development agencies coordinate their activities to improve and develop agriculture,forestry,fisheries, and land andwater resources. It also conducts research, provides technical assistance to projects, operates educational and training programs, and collects agricultural output, production, and development data.[3]\nThe FAO is governed by a biennial conference representing each member country and theEuropean Union, which elects a 49-member executive council.[4]The director-general, as of 2019Qu Dongyuof China, serves as the chief administrative officer.[5]Various committees govern matters such as finance, programs, agriculture, and fisheries.[6]\nThe idea of an internationalorganizationfor food and agriculture emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century, advanced primarily by Polish-born American agriculturalist and activistDavid Lubin. In May\u2013June 1905, an international conference was held inRome, Italy, which led to the creation of theInternational Institute of Agriculture(IIA) by theKing of Italy,Victor Emmanuel III.[7]\nThe IIA was the first intergovernmental organization to deal with the problems and challenges of agriculture on a global scale. It worked primarily to collect, compile, and publish data on agriculture, ranging from output statistics to a catalog of crop diseases. Among its achievements was the publication of the first agricultural census in 1930.[8]\nWorld War IIeffectively ended the IIA. During the war, in 1943, United States PresidentFranklin D. Rooseveltcalled a League of Nations Conference on Food and Agriculture, which brought representatives from forty-four governments toThe Omni Homestead ResortinHot Springs, Virginia, from 18 May to 3 June to attend theHot Springs Conference. The main impetus for the conference was the British-born Australian economistFrank L. McDougall, who since 1935 had advocated for an international forum to address hunger andmalnutrition.[9]\nThe Conference ended with a commitment to establish a permanent organization for food and agriculture, which was achieved on 16 October 1945 inQuebec City, Canada, following the Constitution of the Food and Agriculture Organization.[10]The first session of the FAO Conference began the same day in theCh\u00e2teau FrontenacinQuebec Cityand ended on 1 November 1945.[11]This was led by Sir John Boyd Orr where his work on ending world hunger and creation of FAO resulted in him winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1949.[12]\nAfter the war, the IIA was officially dissolved by resolution of its Permanent Committee on 27 February 1948. Its functions, facilities, and mandate were then transferred to the newly established FAO, which maintained its headquarters in Rome.[13]\nThe FAO's initial functions supported agricultural and nutrition research and provided technical assistance to member countries to boost production in agriculture, fishery, and forestry.[14]Beginning in the 1960s, it focused on efforts to develop high-yield strains of grain, eliminate protein deficiency, promote rural employment, and increase agricultural exports. The FAO recognized the decrease of these resources as an urgent problem in 1961 and created a joint collaboration with the International Biological Program (IBP) in 1967.[15]To that end, it joined theUN General Assemblyin creating the UNWorld Food Programme, the largest humanitarian organization addressing hunger and promoting food security.\nThe FAO launched what would become the FAO Money and Medals Programme (MMP) in 1968. FAO issued collector art medals in various series to bring attention to FAO's goals and missions. This program was responsible for over a hundred medal designs issued to the collecting public. A thirtieth anniversary medal of the MMP was issued in 1998.\nIn 1974, in response to famine in Africa, the FAO convened the first World Food Summit to address widespread hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity.[16]The meeting resulted in a proclamation that \"every man, woman, and child has the inalienable right to be free from hunger and malnutrition to develop their physical and mental faculties\" and a global commitment to eradicate these issues within a decade. A subsequent summit in 1996 addressed the shortcomings in achieving this goal while establishing a strategic plan for eliminating hunger and malnutrition into the 21st century.[16]\nEvery year, FAO publishes a number of major 'State of the World' reports related to food, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and natural resources.[17]\nIn 1951, the FAO's headquarters were moved from Washington, D.C., United States, toRome, Italy. The agency is directed by the Conference of Member Nations, which meets every two years to review the work carried out by the organization and to Work and Budget for the next two-year period. The conference elects a council of 49 member states (serve three-year rotating terms) that acts as an interim governing body, and the director-general, who heads the agency.\nThe FAO is composed of eight departments: Agriculture and Consumer Protection,Climate,Biodiversity, Land and Water Department, Economic and Social Development,FisheriesandAquaculture,Forestry, Corporate Services and Technical Cooperation and Programme Management.[18]\nBeginning in 1994, the FAO underwent the most significant restructuring since its founding, to decentralize operations, streamline procedures and reduce costs. As a result, savings of about US$50 million, \u20ac43 million a year were realized.[19]\nThe FAO's Regular Programme budget is funded by its members, through contributions set at the FAO Conference. This budget covers core technical work, cooperation and partnerships including the Technical Cooperation Programme, knowledge exchange, policy and advocacy, direction and administration, governance and security.\nThe total FAO Budget planned for 2018\u20132019 is US$1,005.6 million.[20]The voluntary contributions provided by members and other partners support mechanical and emergency (including rehabilitation) assistance to governments for clearly defined purposes linked to the results framework, as well as direct support to FAO's core work. The voluntary contributions are expected to reach approximately US$1.6billionin 2016\u20132017.\nThis overall budget covers core technical work, cooperation and partnerships, leading to Food and Agriculture Outcomes at 71 percent; Core Functions at 11 percent; the Country Office Network \u2013 5 percent; Capital and Security Expenditure \u2013 2 percent; Administration \u2013 6 percent; and Technical and Cooperation Program \u2013 5 percent.\nTheworld headquartersis located inRome, in the former seat of the Department ofItalian East Africa. One of the most notable features of the building was theAxum Obeliskwhich stood in front of the agency seat, although just outside the territory allocated to the FAO by theItalian Government. It was taken fromEthiopiabyBenito Mussolini's troops in 1937 as war booty and returned on 18 April 2005.\nPartnership and Liaison Offices provide for stronger country participation in the FAO's work and programmes at national, sub-regional, regional, and inter-regional levels, and enhanced cooperation through unilateral trust fund projects andSouth\u2013South cooperation.\nFAO has outlined the following priorities in its fight against hunger.[22]\nTwo fundamental areas of work \u2013 gender and governance \u2013 are fully integrated in the above strategic objective action plans.\nFAO and the World Health Organization created theCodex Alimentarius Commissionin 1961 to develop food standards, guidelines, and texts such as codes of practice under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme. The programme's main aims are protecting consumer health, ensuring fair trade, and promoting co-ordination of all food standards work undertaken by intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations.\nIn 1996, FAO organized theWorld Food Summit, attended by 112 Heads or Deputy Heads of State and Government. The Summit concluded with the signing of theRome Declaration, which established the goal of halving the number of people who suffer from hunger by 2015.[23]At the same time, 1,200 civil society organizations (CSOs) from 80 countries participated in an NGO forum. The forum was critical of the growing industrialization of agriculture and called upon governments \u2013 and FAO \u2013 to do more to protect the 'Right to Food' for the poor.[24]\nIn 1997, FAO launched TeleFood, a campaign of concerts, sporting events, and other activities to harness the power of media, celebrities, and concerned citizens to help fight hunger. Since its start, the campaign has generated close to US$28 million, \u20ac15 million in donations. Money raised through TeleFood pays for small, sustainable projects that help small-scale farmers produce more food for their families and communities.[25]\nThe projects provide tangible resources, such as fishing equipment, seeds, and agricultural implements. They vary enormously, from helping families raise pigs in Venezuela through creating school gardens in Cape Verde and Mauritania or providing school lunches in Uganda and teaching children to grow food to raising fish in a leper community in India.\nTheFAO Goodwill AmbassadorsProgramme was initiated in 1999. It was created to increase public awareness and disseminate information about issues related to food security and hunger in the world.\nIn 2004 theRight to Food Guidelineswere adopted which offer guidance to states on how to implement their obligations on theright to food.[26]\nIn December 2007, FAO launched its Initiative on soaring food prices to help small producers raise their output and earn more. Under the initiative, FAO contributed to the work of the UN High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis, which produced the Comprehensive Framework for Action. FAO has carried out projects in over 25 countries and inter-agency missions in nearly 60, scaled up its monitoring through the Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture, provided policy advice to governments while supporting their efforts to increase food production, and advocated for more investment in agriculture as well as provided funding to distribute and multiply quality seeds in Haiti,[27]which has significantly increased food production, thereby providing cheaper food.\nIn May 2009, FAO and the European Union signed an initial aid package worth \u20ac125 million to support small farmers in countries hit hard by rising food prices. The aid package falls under the EU's \u20ac1 billion Food Facility, set up with theUN Secretary-General's High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis and FAO to focus on programmes that will have a quick but lasting impact on food security.[28]FAO is receiving around \u20ac200 million for work in 25 countries, of which \u20ac15.4 million goes to Zimbabwe.[29]\nThe Special Programme for Food Security is FAO's flagship initiative for reaching the goal of halving the number of hungry in the world by 2015 (currently estimated at close to 1 billion people) as part of its commitment to theMillennium Development Goals. Through projects in over 100 countries worldwide, the programme promotes effective, tangible solutions to eliminating hunger, undernourishment, and poverty. Currently, 102 countries are engaged in the programme, and of these, approximately 30 have begun shifting from pilot to national programmes. To maximize the impact of its work, FAO strongly promotes national ownership and local empowerment in the countries in which it operates.[30]\nThe 1billionhungry project became the EndingHunger campaign in April 2011. Spearheaded by FAO in partnership with other UN agencies and private nonprofit groups, the EndingHunger movement pushes the boundaries of conventional public advocacy. It builds on the success in 2010 of The 1billonhungry project and the subsequent chain of public events that led to the collection of over three million signatures on a global petition to end hunger (www.EndingHunger.org). The petition was originally presented to representatives of world governments at a ceremony in Rome on 30 November 2010.[31]\nThe web and partnerships are two pivotal and dynamic aspects of EndingHunger. The campaign relies on the assistance of organizations and institutions that can facilitate the project's diffusion, by placing banners on their own websites or organizing events aimed to raise awareness of the project. In its 2011 season, the campaign expanded its multimedia content, pursued mutual visibility arrangements with partner organizations, and sharpened its focus on 14- to 25-year-olds, who were encouraged to understand their potential as a social movement to push for the end of hunger.\nMoreover, the EndingHunger project is a viral communication campaign, renewing and expanding its efforts to build the movement through Facebook, Twitter and other social networks. Those who sign the petition can spread the link of the EndingHunger website to their friends, via social media or mail, in order to gain awareness and signatures for the petition. The next interim objective is to grow the EndingHunger movement's Facebook community to 1 million members. As with the petition, the more people who get involved, the more powerful the message to governments: \"We are no longer willing to accept the fact that hundreds of millions live in chronic hunger.\"[32]Groups and individuals can also decide on their own to organize an event about the project, simply by gathering friends, whistles, T-shirts and banners (whistles and T-shirts can be ordered, and petition sign sheets downloaded, on the endinghunger.org website) and thereby alert people about chronic hunger by using the yellow whistle.\nThe original 1billionhungry campaign borrowed as its slogan the line \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\", used byPeter Finchin the 1976 film,Network.[33]Meanwhile, the yellow whistle has been the campaign symbol from the start, from 1billionhungry to Ending Hunger. (The creative concept was provided by the McCann Erickson Italy Communication Agency.) It symbolizes the fact that we are \"blowing the whistle\" on the silent disaster of hunger. It is both a symbol and \u2013 at many live events taking place around the world \u2013 a physical means of expressing frustration and making some noise about the hunger situation.[34]\nBoth The 1billionhungry and the EndingHunger campaigns have continued to attractUN Goodwill Ambassadorsfrom the worlds of music and cinema, literature, sport, activism and government. Some of the well known individuals who have become involved include former Brazilian PresidentLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, former presidents of ChileRicardo LagosandMichelle Bachelet, actressSusan Sarandon, actorsJeremy IronsandRaul Bova, singersC\u00e9line DionandAnggun, authorsIsabelle AllendeandAndrea Camilleri, musicianChucho Vald\u00e9sand Olympic track-and-field legendCarl Lewis.[35]\nFAO created theInternational Plant Protection Conventionor IPPC in 1952. This international treaty organization works to prevent the international spread of pests and plant diseases in both cultivated and wild plants. Among its functions are the maintenance of lists of plant pests, tracking of pest outbreaks, and coordination of technical assistance between member nations. As of July 2018, 183 contracting parties have ratified the treaty.\nFAO is depositary of theInternational Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, also calledPlant Treaty,Seed TreatyorITPGRFA, entered into force on 29 June 2004.\nThe Alliance Against Hunger and Malnutrition (AAHM)[36]aims to address how countries and organizations can be more effective in advocating and carrying out actions to address hunger and malnutrition. As a global partnership, AAHM creates global connections between local, regional, national and international institutions that share the goals of fighting hunger and malnutrition. The organization works to address food security by enhancing resources and knowledge sharing and strengthening hunger activities within countries and across state lines at the regional and international levels.\nFollowing theWorld Food Summit, the Alliance was initially created in 2002 as the 'International Alliance Against Hunger (IAAH)' to strengthen and coordinate national efforts in the fight against hunger and malnutrition. The mission of the Alliance originates from the first and eighthUN Millennium Development Goals; reducing the number of people that suffer from hunger in half by 2015 (preceded by the \"Rome Declaration\" in 1996) and developing a global partnership for development. The Alliance was founded by the Rome-based food agencies \u2013 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),[37]UN World Food Programme(WFP),[38]International Fund for Agricultural Development(IFAD),[39]\u2013 andBioversity International.[40]\nAAHM connects top-down and bottom-up anti-hunger development initiatives, linking governments, UN organizations, and NGOs together in order to increase effectiveness through unity.[41]\nDuring the 1990s, FAO took a leading role in the promotion ofintegrated pest managementfor rice production in Asia. Hundreds of thousands of farmers were trained using an approach known as theFarmer Field School(FFS).[42]Like many of the programmes managed by FAO, the funds for Farmer Field Schools came from bilateral Trust Funds, with Australia,Netherlands,NorwayandSwitzerlandacting as the leading donors. FAO's efforts in this area have drawn praise from NGOs that have otherwise criticized much of the work of the organization.\nFAO established anEmergency Prevention System for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseasesin 1994, focusing on the control of diseases likerinderpest,foot-and-mouth diseaseandavian fluby helping governments coordinate their responses. One key element is theGlobal Rinderpest Eradication Programme, which has advanced to a stage where large tracts of Asia and Africa have now been free of the cattle disease rinderpest for an extended period of time. Meanwhile, theDesert Locust Information Servicemonitors the worldwide locust situation and keeps affected countries and donors informed of expected developments.[43]\nThe Global Partnership Initiative for Plant Breeding Capacity Building (GIPB) is a global partnership dedicated to increasing plant breeding capacity building.[44]The mission of GIPB is to enhance the capacity of developing countries to improve crops for food security and sustainable development through better plant breeding and delivery systems.[45]The ultimate goal is to ensure that a critical mass of plant breeders, leaders, managers and technicians, donors and partners are linked together through an effective global network.\nIncreasing capacity building for plant breeding in developing countries is critical for the achievement of meaningful results in poverty and hunger reduction and to reverse the current worrisome trends. Plant breeding is a well recognized science capable of widening the genetic and adaptability base of cropping systems, by combining conventional selection techniques and modern technologies. It is essential to face and prevent the recurrence of crises such as that\nof the soaring food prices and to respond to the increasing demands for crop based sources of energy.\nFAO's technical cooperation department hosts an Investment Centre that promotes greater investment in agriculture and rural development by helping developing countries identify and formulate sustainable agricultural policies, programmes and projects. It mobilizes funding from multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, regional development banks and international funds as well as FAO resources.[46]\nThe Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) Partnership Initiative was conceptualized and presented by Parviz Koohafkan the Task Manager of Chapter 10 of Agenda 21 in Food and Agricultural Organization of United Nations, FAO in 2002 during World Summit on Sustainable Development inJohannesburg, South Africa.[47]This UN Partnership Initiative aims to identify, support and safeguard Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems and their livelihoods, agricultural and associated biodiversity, landscapes, knowledge systems and cultures around the world. The GIAHS Partnership recognizes the crucial importance of the well-being of family farming communities in an integrated approach while directing activities towards sustainable agriculture and rural development.\nThe Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, established in 1983, provides an intergovernmental forum that specifically addresses biological diversity for food and agriculture. Its main objective is to ensure the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity for food and agriculture and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from its use, for present and future generations.\nFAO has a unit focused onAnimal Genetic Resources, which are defined as \"those animal species that are used, or may be used, for the production of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them. These populations within each species can be classified as wild and feral populations, land-races and primary populations, standardized breeds, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds.\"[48]FAO assists countries in implementation of theGlobal Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources. FAO supports a variety ofex situandin situconservation strategies includingcryoconservation of animal genetic resources.\nOne of FAO's strategic goals is the sustainable management of the world's forests. TheForestry Division[49]works to balance social and environmental considerations with the economic needs of rural populations living in forest areas. FAO serves as a neutral forum for policy dialogue, as a reliable source of information on forests and trees and as a provider of expert technical assistance and advice to help countries develop and implement effective national forest programmes.\nFAO is both a global clearinghouse for information on forests and forest resources and a facilitator that helps building countries' local capacity to provide their own national forest data. In collaboration with member countries, FAO carries out periodic global assessments of forest resources, which are made available through reports, publications and the FAO's Web site.[50]TheGlobal Forest Resources Assessment[51]provides comprehensive reporting on forests worldwide every five years. FRA 2020 is the most recent global assessment. The results, data and analyses are available online in different formats, including key findings, main report and country reports.[52]\nEvery two years, FAO publishes theState of the World's Forests,[53]a major report covering current and emerging issues facing the forestry sector.\nSince 1947, FAO has published the FAO Yearbook of Forest Products,[54]a compilation of statistical data on basic forest products from over 100 countries and territories of the world. It contains data on the volume of production; and the volume, value and direction of trade in forest products.\nUnasylva,[55]FAO's peer-reviewed journal on forestry, has been published in English, French and Spanish on a regular basis since 1947, the longest-running multilingual forestry journal in the world.\nThe FAO is an official sponsor ofInternational Day of Forests, on 21 March each year, as proclaimed by theUnited Nations General Assemblyon 28 November 2012.[56]\nEvery six years since 1926, FAO and a host member state hold theWorld Forestry Congress. It is a forum for the sharing of knowledge and experience regarding the conservation, management and use of the world's forests, and covers such issues as international dialogue, socio-economic and institutional aspects, and forest policies.\nThe Forestry Department is also organized geographically in several groups covering the whole world's forest ecosystems. One of them is the Silva Mediterranean work-group, covering the pan-Mediterranean region.\nAt the World Forum on Urban Forests in October 2018, the FAO and theArbor Day Foundationjointly launched theTree Cities of the Worldprogramme. The aim of this programme is to celebrate and recognize cities and towns of all sizes throughout the world which have shown a commitment to maintaining theirurban forests.[57]From the end of 2019, any municipality which has responsibility for its trees was able to apply to join Tree Cities of the World.[58]On 4 February 2020, 59 cities were announced as having achieved the designation of Tree City of the World. There were 27 in the United States, with the rest scattered across the world.[59][60]\nThe FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department is defined through its vision and mission statements:\nThe work of the Fisheries and Aquaculture Department centers on the \"Sustainable management and use of fisheries and aquaculture resource\", embracing normative as well as operational activities, whether implemented from headquarters or from the field.[62]\nThe FAOCode of Conduct for Responsible Fisherieswas adopted in 1995.[63]\nESSGis anacronymfor theGlobal Statistics Service, the major \"section\" of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization - Statistics Division. It is responsible for updating and disseminating the FAOSTAT report.[64][65]This offers free and easy access to data for 245 countries and 35 regional areas from 1961 through the most recent year available. Enhanced features include browsing and analysis of data, an advanced interactive data download, and enhanced data exchange through web services.\nThe Land and Water Division maintains a database of global water statistics, Aquastat.[66]The Fisheries and Aquaculture Division maintains a database of global Fisheries and Aquaculture statistics, FishStat.[67]\nAs of 1 May 2020, the Organization has 194 Member Nations, one Member Organization, and two Associate Members.\nTaiwan (at the time representing China), withdrew from the FAO in 1951.[68]in 1971, thePeople's Republic of Chinawas recognized as the representative   of China  by the FAO and the withdrawal from part of Taiwan was not taken into account.[68]\nThe onlyUN member statethat is a non-member of the FAO isLiechtenstein.[69][70]\nBothUN observer statesare also non-members of the FAO: theHoly See(Vatican City) andPalestine.\nSome countries may denote specific representatives to the FAO, for instance theUnited States Ambassador to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, who has ambassador rank and is also a part of theUnited States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome.\nThere has been public criticism of FAO for at least 30 years. Dissatisfaction with the organization's performance was among the reasons for the creation of two new organizations after the World Food Conference in 1974, namely theWorld Food Counciland theInternational Fund for Agricultural Development; by the early eighties there was intense rivalry among these organizations.[71]At the same time, theWorld Food Programme, which started as an experimental three-year programme under FAO, was growing in size and independence, with the Directors of FAO and WFP struggling for power.[72]\nEarly in 1989, the organization came under attack fromHeritage Foundation, an American conservativethink tank, which described the FAO as becoming \"essentially irrelevant in combating hunger\" due to a \"bloated bureaucracy known for the mediocrity of its work and the inefficiency of its staff\", which had become politicized.[73]In September of the same year, the journalSocietypublished a series of articles about FAO[74]that included a contribution from the Heritage Foundation and a response by FAO staff member, Richard Lydiker, who was later described by the Danish Minister for Agriculture (who had herself resigned from the organization) as \"FAO's chief spokesman for non-transparency\".[75]\nIn 1990, the U.S. State Department expressed the view that \"The Food and Agriculture Organization has lagged behind other UN organizations in responding to US desires for improvements in program and budget processes to enhance value for money spent\".[76]\nA year later, in 1991,The Ecologistmagazine produced a special issue under the heading \"The UN Food and Agriculture Organization: Promoting World Hunger\".[77]The magazine included articles that questioned FAO's policies and practices in forestry,fisheries,aquaculture, andpest control. The articles were written by experts such asHelena Norberg-Hodge,Vandana Shiva,Edward Goldsmith,Miguel A. AltieriandBarbara Dinham.\nThe 2002 Food Summit organized by FAO was considered to have been ineffectual and unproductive by the official participants.[78]Social movements, farmers, fisherfolk, pastoralists, indigenous peoples, environmentalists, women's organizations, trade unions and NGOs expressed their \"collective disappointment in, and rejection of the official Declaration of the\u00a0... Summit\".[79]\nIn 2004, FAO produced a controversial report called \"Agricultural Biotechnology: meeting the needs of the poor?\", which claimed that \"agriculturalbiotechnologyhas real potential as a new tool in the war on hunger\".[80]In response to the report, more than 650 organizations from around the world signed an open letter in which they said \"FAO has broken its commitment to civil society and peasants' organisations\". The letter complained that organizations representing the interests of farmers had not been consulted, that FAO was siding with the biotechnology industry and, consequently, that the report \"raises serious questions about the independence and intellectual integrity of an important United Nations agency\".[81]Jacques Diouf, the Director General of FAO at that time, responded immediately, stating that decisions on biotechnology must \"be taken at the international level by competent bodies\" (in other words, not by non-governmental organizations). He acknowledged, however, that \"biotechnology research is essentially driven by the world's top tentransnational corporations\" and \"the private sector protects its results withpatentsin order to earn from its investment and it concentrates on products that have no relevance to food in developing countries\".[82]\nIn May 2006, a British newspaper published the resignation letter ofLouise Fresco, one of eight Assistant Directors-General of FAO. In her letter, Fresco stated that \"the Organization has been unable to adapt to a new era\", that its \"contribution and reputation have declined steadily\" and \"its leadership has not proposed bold options to overcome this crisis\".[83]\nThe 32nd Session of FAO's Committee on World Food Security in 2006, attended by 120 countries, was widely criticized by non-governmental organizations, but largely ignored by the mainstream media.Oxfamcalled for an end to the talk-fests[84]whileVia Campesinaissued a statement that criticised FAO's policy of Food Security.[85]\nOn 18 October 2007, the final report of an Independent External Evaluation of FAO was published. More than 400 pages in length, the evaluation was the first of its kind in the history of the Organization. It had been commissioned by decision of the 33rd Session of the FAO Conference in November 2005. The report concluded that \"The Organization is today in a financial and programme crisis\" but \"the problems affecting the Organization today can all be solved\".[86]Among the problems noted by the IEE were: \"The Organization has been conservative and slow to adapt\"; \"FAO currently has a heavy and costly bureaucracy\", and \"The capacity of the Organization is declining and many of its core competencies are now imperilled\". Among the solutions offered were: \"A new Strategic Framework\", \"institutional culture change and reform of administrative and management systems\". In conclusion the IEE stated that, \"If FAO did not exist it would need to be invented\".\nThe official response from FAO came on 29 October 2007. It indicated that management supported the principal conclusion in the report of the IEE on the need for \"reform with growth\" so as to have an FAO \"fit for this century\".[87]Meanwhile, hundreds of FAO staff signed a petition in support of the IEE recommendations, calling for \"a radical shift in management culture and spirit, depoliticization of appointments, restoration of trust between staff and management, [and] setting strategic priorities of the organization\".[88]\nIn May 2008, while talking about the ongoingworld food crisis, PresidentAbdoulaye WadeofSenegalexpressed the opinion that FAO was \"a waste of money\" and that \"we must scrap it\". Wade said that FAO was itself largely to blame for the price rises, and that the organization's work was duplicated by other bodies that operated more efficiently, like the UN'sInternational Fund for Agricultural Development.[89]However, this criticism may have had more to do with personal animosity between the President and the Director-General, himself a Senegalese, particularly in light of the significant differences in the work carried out by the two organizations.\nIn June 2008, the FAO sponsored theHigh-Level Conference on World Food Security. The summit was notable for the lack of agreement over the issue ofbiofuels.[90]The response to the summit among non-governmental organizations was mixed, withOxfamstating that \"the summit in Rome was an important first step in tackling the food crisis but greater action is now needed\",[91]while Maryam Rahmanian of Iran's Centre for Sustainable Development said \"We are dismayed and disgusted to see the food crisis used to further the policies that have led us to the food crisis in the first place\".[92]As with previous food summits, civil society organizations held a parallel meeting and issued their own declaration to \"reject the corporate industrial and energy-intensive model of production and consumption that is the basis of continuing crises.\"[93]\nIn November 2008, a Special Conference of FAO member countries agreed a US$42.6 million (\u20ac38.6 million), three-year Immediate Plan of Action for \"reform with growth\", as recommended by the IEE. Under the plan US$21.8 million would be spent on overhauling the financial procedures, hierarchies and human resources management.[94]\nFrom 2013, an English-language newspaper based in Rome,The Italian Insider, made several allegations of nepotism and corruption within FAO and reported on poor management-staff relations. In June 2018, FAO and four of its officials took the paper and its editor, John Philips, to court alleging defamation, using a law dating back to thefascist erain Italy.[95]Reporters Without Borderscondemned \"the disproportionate nature of the defamation proceedings\", for which the newspaper was liable for a fine of up to Euros 100,000 and the editor at least three years in prison.[96]The case was adjourned until January 2019, when it was further adjourned until May 2019. The January hearing was considered by the British satirical magazinePrivate Eyeto have been \"one of the more surreal courtroom scenes in modern times\", involving dispute as to the meaning of an English slang word used by theInsider.[97]\nIn 2016/17 FAO was heavily criticized for recruitingNadine HerediaAlarc\u00f3n de Humala, wife of the former president of Peru,Ollanta Humala, to a senior position, at a time when she was being investigated by Peru following corruption allegations.[98][99]Critics includedTransparency International.[100]\nAt the end of April 2017, FAO staff unions addressed the organization's Governing Council to complain about the practice of issuing short-term contracts that \"exploit employees without providing job security, social security and paid leave\". Other complaints included the increasing centralization of management processes, despite claims that FAO was being decentralized, and the failure to follow United Nations recommendations regarding increasing the retirement age. The staff representative also complained about the high percentage of unfilled positions, increasing the workload for others who were under pressure to deliver more with less. She also noted that contacts between Management and the staff bodies were becoming less and less frequent.[101]\nAn investigation by the German public broadcaster ARD shows that the Chinese leadership of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO has tailored it to Chinese interests sinceQu Dongyutook office in 2019. According to the report, the acting director-general has instrumentalized the FAO in Beijing's interests: It is about deliveries ofpesticidesbanned in Europe, the majority of which come from the Chinese agrochemical companySyngenta, UN projects in line with China's \"Belt and Road Initiative\" as well as questionable investment projects.[102][103]\nThe FAO Conference in November 2007 unanimously welcomed the IEE report and established a Conference Committee for the Follow-up to the Independent External Evaluation of FAO (CoC-IEE) to be chaired by the Independent Chairperson of Council, and open to full participation by all Members. The CoC-IEE was charged to review the IEE report and its recommendations and develop an Immediate Plan of Action (IPA) for their implementation.[104]\nA comprehensive programme of organizational reform and culture change began in 2008 after the release of an Independent External Evaluation. Headquarters restructuring and delegation of decision making created a flatter more responsive structure and reduced costs. Modernizing and streamlining of administrative and operational processes took place. Improved internal teamwork and closer external partnerships coupled with upgrading of IT infrastructure and greater autonomy of FAO's decentralized offices now allows the Organization to respond quickly where needs are greatest. As FAO is primarily a knowledge based organization, investing in human resources is a top priority. Capacity building including a leadership programme, employee rotation and a new junior professional programme were established. Individual performance management, an ethics and ombudsman officer and an independent office of evaluation were designed to improve performance through learning and strengthened oversight.\nIn January 2012, the Director-GeneralJos\u00e9 Graziano da Silvaacted upon the commitment made during his campaign to bring the FAO reform to a successful and anticipated completion. In addition, the new Director-General shifted the focus of the reform process to realization of its benefits and mainstreaming the reform into the work of the Organization.[105]\nIn July 2020, the FAO Council approved a series of measures proposed by its Director-GeneralQu Dongyuto modernize the organisation and make it more efficient and effective. An important element within the approved measures is the adoption \"of a more flexible organizational structure, aimed at ensuring agility, optimal cross-sectoral collaboration and better responses to emerging needs and priorities\".[106][107]", "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farming": "Contents\nFarming\nHistory\nTypes\nLivestock\nFood\nProblems\nCrops\nRelated pages\nAgriculture by country\nReferences\n7379816834\n\nFarming started thousands of years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is.[1]The development of farming gave rise to theNeolithic Revolutionas people gave upnomadichuntingand becamesettlersin cities.\nFarming anddomesticationprobably started in theFertile Crescent(theNileValley, theLevantandMesopotamia).[2]The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries ofIraq,Syria,Turkey,Jordan,Lebanon,Israel, andEgypt.Wheatandbarleyare some of the first crops people grew.\nCotton wasdomesticatedin Peru by 4200 BC.[3]\nLivestock including horses, cattle, sheep, and goats were taken to theAmericas, from theOld World. The first of those horses, came with the Spanishconquistadors[4](or soldiers andexplorers) in the 1490s. Moving those cattle, sheep, goats and horses, were part of theColumbian Exchange.\nPeople probably started agriculture by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people thanhunter-gathererscan feed on the same amount of land.\nThis allowed thehuman population to growto such large numbers as there are today.[5][6]\nMany people still live bysubsistence farming, on a small farm. They can only grow enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals. Theyieldis the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and it is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally lesseducated, and they have lessmoneyto buy equipment.Droughtand other problems sometimes causefamines. Where yields are low,deforestationcan provide new land to grow more food. This provides morenutritionfor the farmer's family, but can be bad for the country and the surroundingenvironmentover many years.\nIn some countries, farms are often fewer and larger. During the 20th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow bettervarietiesof plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, so fewer people can farm more land. There are fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to grow more.\nThis kind ofintensive agriculturecomes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers,pesticides(chemicals that kill bugs), andherbicides(chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals canpollutethesoilor the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged byerosion(blowing or washing away), salt builddup, or loss of structure.Irrigation(adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. These problems have all got solutions, and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education.\nFarmers select plants with better yield, taste, andnutritionalvalue. They also choose plants that can surviveplant diseaseanddrought, and are easier to harvest. Centuries ofartificial selectionand breeding have changed crop plants. The crops produce better yield.Fertilizers, chemicalpest control, andirrigationall help.\nSome plants are improved withgenetic engineering. One example is modifying the plant to resist herbicides.\nFarms may also keep animals. That is calledanimal husbandry. If they are used to make meat for people to eat, that islivestockproduction. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, are kept for their produce. \"Produce\" here means their eggs and milk, which are sold by the farm, usually inmarkets. Large animals need grassland of some kind for grazing. What they need depends on the animals.Goatseat a much wider range of plants than cows. In some parts of the world, that makes goats a more sensible choice for a farmer than cows.\nIt is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. People say it is not always safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture.\nAgriculturalpolicymeans the goals and methods of agricultural production. Common goals of policy include the quality, amount, and safety of food.\nThere are some serious problems that people face trying to grow food today.\nThese include:\nThere are also difficulties with the distribution of food:\nIn produced weight, these crops are the most important (global production in metric tonnes):[7]\nThe figure for sugarcane is rather deceptive.

It combines a variety ofsustainable agriculturetechniques.[4]Practices include maximal recycling of farm waste and addingcompostedmaterial from non-farm sources.[5][6][7][8]Regenerative agriculture on small farms and gardens is based onpermaculture,agroecology,agroforestry,restoration ecology,keyline design, andholistic management. Large farms are also increasingly adopting regenerative techniques, using \"no-till\" and/or \"reduced till\" practices.\nAssoil healthimproves, input requirements may decrease, and crop yields may increase as soils are more resilient toextreme weatherand harbor fewer pests andpathogens.[9]\nRegenerative agriculturemitigates climate changethroughcarbon dioxide removalfrom the atmosphere and sequestration. Along with reduction of carbon emissions, carbon sequestration is gaining popularity in agriculture, andindividuals as well as groupsare taking action to fight climate change.[10]\nRegenerative agriculture is based on various agricultural and ecological practices, with a particular emphasis on minimal soil disturbance and the practice of composting.[11]Similar ideas focus on \"sea minerals.\"[12][13]His work led to innovations in no-till practices, such asslash and mulchin tropical regions.[14][15][16]Sheet mulchingis a regenerative agriculture practice that smothers weeds and adds nutrients to the soil below.[17][18]\nIn the early 1980s,the Rodale Institutebegan using the term \u2018regenerative agriculture\u2019.[19]Rodale Publishing formed the Regenerative Agriculture Association, which began publishing regenerative agriculture books in 1987 and 1988.[20]\nBy marching forward under the banner of sustainability we are, in effect, continuing to hamper ourselves by not accepting a challenging enough goal. I am not against the word sustainable, rather I favor regenerative agriculture.\nHowever, the institute stopped using the term in the late 1980s, and it only appeared sporadically (in 2005[21]and 2008), until they released a white paper in 2014, titled \"Regenerative Organic Agriculture and Climate Change\".[22]The paper's summary states, \"we could sequester more than 100% of current annualCO2emissionswith a switch to common and inexpensive organic management practices, which we term 'regenerative organic agriculture.'\" The paper described agricultural practices, likecrop rotation,compostapplication, and reduced tillage,[22]that are similar toorganic agriculturemethods.[23]\nIn 2002, Storm Cunningham documented the beginning of what he called \"restorative agriculture\" in his first book,The Restoration Economy. Cunningham defined restorative agriculture as a technique that rebuilds the quantity and quality of topsoil, while also restoring local biodiversity (especially native pollinators) and watershed function. Restorative agriculture was one of the eight sectors of restorative development industries/disciplines inThe Restoration Economy.[24]\nRegenerative agriculture has showed up in academic research since the early to mid 2010s in the fields ofenvironmental science, plant science, andecology.[25]As the term expands in use, many books have been published on the topic and several organizations started to promote regenerative agriculture techniques.Allan Savorygave a TED talk on fighting and reversing climate change in 2013. He also launched The Savory Institute, which educates ranchers on methods of holistic land management. Abe Collins created LandStream to monitor ecosystem performance in regenerative agriculture farms.[26]Eric Toensmeier had a book published on the subject in 2016.[27]However, researchers at Wageningen University in the Netherlands found there to be no consistent definition of what people referencing \"regenerative agriculture\" meant. They also found that most of the work around this topic were instead the authors' attempt at shaping what regenerative agriculture meant.[4]\nIn 2011, the (not for profit) Mulloon Institute was founded in New South Wales, Australia, to develop and promote regenerative practices to reclaim land as water-retentive areas by slowing the loss of water from land.[28]The members of the Institute created a 22-weir in-stream project with neighbours over 2 kilometers of Mulloon Creek. A study indicates that the outcomes were positive but relatively unpredictable, and that suitability of ground conditions on site was a key for success.[29]Bottom-up change in the context of Australian regenerative agriculture is a complex set of narratives and barriers to change affecting farmers.[30]A West Australian government funded survey of land hydration was conducted by the Mulloon Institute in June 2022, which concluded that water retention projects supported the regeneration of native plant species.[31]\nFounded in 2013, 501(c)3 non-profit Kiss the Ground was one of the first to publicize the term to a broader audience. Today the group runs a series of media, farmland, education, and policy programs to raise awareness around soil health and support farmers who aim to transition from conventional to regenerative land management practices.[32]The filmKiss the Ground, executive produced byJulian LennonandGisele B\u00fcndchenand narrated byWoody Harrelson, was released in 2020.[33]A follow-up documentary,Common Ground, premiered in 2023 and was the recipient of the 2023 Human/Nature Award at the Tribeca Film Festival.[34]\nNot all regenerative systems emphasize ruminants. In 2017, Reginaldo Haslett Marroquin published \"In the Shadow ofGreen Man\" with Per Andreeason,[35]which detailed Haslett Marroquin's early life as a campesino in Guatemala and how these experiences led him to develop regenerativepoultryagroforestrysystems that are now being practiced and expanding in the United States and elsewhere.[36][37]\nSeveral large corporations have also announced regenerative agriculture initiatives in the last few years. In 2019,General Millsannounced an effort to promote regenerative agriculture practices in their supply chain. The farming practices have received criticism from academic and government experiments on sustainability in farming. In particular, Gunsmoke Farm partnered with General Mills to transition to regenerative agriculture practices and become a teaching hub for others. Experts from the area have expressed concerns about the farm now doing more harm than good, with agronomist Ruth Beck stating that \"Environmental marketing got ahead of what farmers can actually do\".[38]\nIn February 2021, the regenerative agriculture market gained traction after Joe Biden'sSecretary of AgricultureTom Vilsackmade reference to it during his Senate Confirmation hearing. TheBiden administrationwants to utilize $30 billion from theUSDA's Commodity Credit Corporations to incentivise farmers to adopt sustainable practices.[39]Vilsack stated in the hearing, \"It is a great tool for us to create the kind of structure that will inform future farm bills about what will encourage carbon sequestration, what will encourage precision agriculture, what will encourage soil health and regenerative agricultural practices.\"[40]After this announcement from the Biden administration, several national and international corporations announced initiatives into regenerative agriculture.[41][42][43]During the House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture's first hearing on climate change, Gabe Brown, a proponent of regenerative agriculture, testified about the role of regenerative agriculture in both the economics and sustainability of farming.[44]\nIn 2021,PepsiCoannounced that by 2030 they will work with the farmers in their supply chain to establish regenerative agriculture practices across their approximately 7 million acres.[45][43]In 2021,Unileverannounced an extensive implementation plan to incorporate regenerative agriculture throughout their supply chain.[42][46]VF Corporation, the parent company ofThe North Face,Timberland, andVans, announced in 2021 a partnership with Terra Genesis International to create a supply chain for their rubber that comes from sources utilizing regenerative agriculture.[41][47]Nestleannounced in 2021 a $1.8 billion investment in regenerative agriculture in an effort to reduce their emissions by 95%.[48]\nSeveral days before the opening of the2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, a report was published, sponsored by some of the biggest agricultural companies. The report was produced bySustainable Markets Initiative, an organisation of companies trying to become climate friendly, established by KingCharles III. According to the report, regenerative agriculture is already implemented on 15% of all cropland. Despite this, the rate of transition is \"far too slow\" and must be tripled by the year 2030 to prevent the global temperature passing the threshold of 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels. Agricultural practices must immediately change in order to avoid the damage that would result. One of the authors emphasised that \u201cThe interconnection between human health and planetary health is more evident than ever before.\u201d The authors proposed a set of measures for accelerating the transition, like creating metrics for measuring how much farming is sustainable, and paying farmers who will change their farming practices to more sustainable ones.[49]\nSeveral individuals, groups, and organizations have attempted to define the principles of regenerative agriculture. In their review of the existing literature on regenerative agriculture, researchers atWageningen Universitycreated a database of 279 research articles on regenerative agriculture.[4]Their analysis of this database found that people using the term regenerative agriculture were using different principles to guide regenerative agriculture efforts.[4]The 4 most consistent principles were found to be, 1) enhancing and improving soil health, 2) optimization of resource management, 3) alleviation of climate change, and 4) improvement of water quality and availability.\nThe organization The Carbon Underground created a set of principles that have been signed on to by a number of non-profits and corporations includingBen & Jerry's, Annie's, and theRodale Institute, which was one of the first organization to use the term \"Regenerative Agriculture\".[50]The principles they've outlined include building soil health and fertility, increase water percolation and retention, increasing biodiversity and ecosystem health, and reducing carbon emissions and current atmospheric CO2levels.[50]\nThe group Terra Genesis International, and VF Corporation's partner in their regenerative agriculture initiative, created a set of 4 principles, which include:[51][5]\nInstead of focusing on the specifics of food production technologies, human ecologistPhilip Loringsuggests afood system-level focus on regeneration, arguing that it is the combination of flexibility anddiversityin our food systems that supports regenerative ecological practices.[52]Loring argues that, depending on the relative flexibility of people in the food system with respect to the foods they eat and the overall diversity of foods being produced and harvested, food systems can fall into one of four general patterns:\nLoring's typology is based on a principle he calls the Conservation of Change, which states that change must always happen somewhere in ecosystems, and derives from theSecond Law of ThermodynamicsandBarry Commoner's premise in that, in ecosystems, \"there is no free lunch\".\nPractices and principles used in regenerative farming include:[7][5][53][54]\nConventional agricultural practices such as plowing and tilling release carbon dioxide (CO2) from the soil by exposing organic matter to the surface and thus promoting oxidation.[65]It is estimated that roughly a third of the total anthropogenic inputs of CO2to the atmosphere since the industrial revolution have come from the degradation of soil organic matter[65]and that 30\u201375% of global soil organic matter has been lost since the advent of tillage-based farming.[66]Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with conventional soil and cropping activities represent 13.7% of anthropogenic emissions, or 1.86 Pg-C y\u22121.[66]The raising of ruminant livestock also contributes GHGs, representing 11.6% of anthropogenic emissions, or 1.58 Pg-C y\u22121.[66]Furthermore, runoff and siltation of water bodies associated with conventional farming practices promote eutrophication and emissions of methane.[66]\nRegenerative agriculture practices such as no-till farming,rotational grazing, mixed crop rotation, cover cropping, and the application of compost and manure have the potential to reverse this trend. No-till farming reintroduces carbon back into the soil as crop residues are pressed down when seeding. Some studies suggest that adoption of no-till practices could triplesoil carboncontent in less than 15 years.[65]Additionally, 1 Pg-C y\u22121, representing roughly a fourth to a third of anthropogenic CO2emissions,[67]may be sequestered by converting croplands to no-till systems on a global scale.[65]\nThere is mixed evidence on the carbon sequestration potential of regenerative grazing. A meta-analysis of relevant studies between 1972 and 2016 found that Holistic Planned Grazing had no better effect than continuous grazing on plant cover and biomass, although it may have benefited some areas with higher precipitation.[68]However, some studies have found positive impacts compared to conventional grazing. One study found that regenerative grazing management, particularly adaptive multipaddock (AMP) grazing, has been shown to reducesoil degradationcompared to continuous grazing and thus has the potential to mitigate carbon emissions from soil.[66]Another study found that crop rotation and maintenance of permanent cover crops help to reduce soil erosion as well, and in conjunction with AMP grazing, may result in netcarbon sequestration.[66]\nThere is a less developed evidence base comparing regenerative grazing with the absence of livestock on grasslands. Several peer-reviewed studies have found that excluding livestock completely from semi-arid grasslands can lead to significant recovery of vegetation and soil carbon sequestration.[69][70][71][72][73]A 2021 peer-reviewed paper found that sparsely grazed and natural grasslands account for 80% of the total cumulative carbon sink of the world\u2019s grasslands, whereas managed grasslands (i.e. with greater livestock density) have been a net greenhouse gas source over the past decade.[74]A 2011 study found that multi-paddock grazing of the type endorsed by Savory resulted in more soil carbon sequestration than heavy continuous grazing, but very slightly less soil carbon sequestration than \"graze exclosure\" (excluding grazing livestock from land).[75]Another peer-reviewed paper found that if current pastureland was restored to its former state as wild grasslands, shrublands, and sparse savannas without livestock this could store an estimated 15.2 - 59.9 Gt additional carbon.[76]\nThe total carbon sequestration potential of regenerative grazing has been debated between advocates and critics. One study suggests that total conversion of livestock raising to AMP grazing practices coupled with conservation cropping has the potential to convert North American farmlands to acarbon sink, sequestering approximately 1.2 Pg-C y\u22121.[66]Over the next 25\u201350 years, the cumulative sequestration potential is 30-60 Pg-C. Additions of organic manures and compost further build soil organic carbon, thus contributing to carbon sequestration potential.[67]However, a study by the Food and Climate Research Network in 2017 estimates that, on the basis of meta-study of the scientific literature, the total global soil carbon sequestration potential from grazing management ranges from 0.3-0.8 Gt CO2eq per year, which is equivalent to offsetting a maximum of 4-11% of current total global livestock emissions, and that \u201cExpansion or intensification in the grazing sector as an approach to sequestering more carbon would lead to substantial increases in methane, nitrous oxide and land use change-induced CO2 emissions\u201d, leading to an overall increase in emissions.[77]Consistent with this, Project Drawdown (referenced in the filmKiss the Ground) estimates the total carbon sequestration potential of improved managed grazing at 13.72 - 20.92 Gigatons CO2eq between 2020\u20132050, equal to 0.46-0.70 Gt CO2eq per year.[78]A 2022 peer-reviewed paper estimated the carbon sequestration potential of improved grazing management at a similar level of 0.15-0.70 Gt CO2eq per year.[79]\nA research made bythe Rodale institutesuggests that a worldwide transition to regenerative agriculture can soak more than 100% of the CO2currently emitted by people.[80]\nSoil organic matter is the primary sink of nutrients necessary for plant growth such as nitrogen, phosphorus, zinc, sulfur, and molybdenum.[67]Conventional tillage-based farming promotes rapid erosion and degradation of soil organic matter, depleting soil of plant nutrients and thus lowering productivity.[65]Tillage, in conjunction with additions of inorganic fertilizer, also destroys soil microbial communities, reducing production of organic nutrients in soil.[65]In contrast, use of organic fertilizer will significantly increase the organic matter in the soil.[65]Practices that restore organic matter may be used to increase the total nutrient load of soil.[67]For example, regenerative management of ruminant livestock in mixed-crop and grazing agroecosystems has been shown to improve soil nutrient cycling by encouraging the consumption and decomposition of residual crop biomass and promoting the recovery of nitrogen-fixing plant species.[66]Regenerative crop management practices, namely the use of crop rotation to ensure permanent ground cover, have the potential to increase soil fertility and nutrient levels if nitrogen-fixing crops are included in the rotation.[66]Crop rotation and rotational grazing also allow the nutrients in soil to recover between growing and grazing periods, thus further enhancing overall nutrient load and cycling.[67]\nThe soil microbiome which consist of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms play an essential role in nutrient cycling by decomposing organic matter and releasing essential nutrients for plant growth.[81]Their activities are needed fordecompositionandmineralizationprocesses, which help to transform complex organic compounds into simpler forms that plants can absorb.[82]In nitrogen cycling,nitrogen-fixing bacteriaconvert organic nitrogen into ammonium (NH\u2084\u207a), which is then converted into nitrate (NO\u2083\u207b) bynitrifying bacteria.[83]While both ammonium and nitrate are important for plant growth, nitrate is the most preferred for many plants due to its mobility, less toxicity, and efficient transport systems. Ammonium is also a great alternative as it is more readily assimilated once inside the plant, it can causetoxicityif taken up in excess.[83]Environmental conditions such as soil pH, and nutrient availability play major roles in determining which form of nitrogen is absorbed first[83]. Soil microbes also play a key role inphosphorus cycling, helping to dissolve phosphorus from organic material for plant availability.[83]A diverse microbial community also helps to preventsoil-borne diseasesand reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers.[84]\nConventional farmingdisrupts nutrient cycling by using practices like tillage, which breaks down soil structure, reduces soil organic matter (SOM), and negatively impacts the overall soil health.[81]Conventional practices lead to reduced crop yields, increased reliance onsynthetic fertilizers, and environmental problems like nutrient runoff and water pollution.[85]Over-reliance on synthetic fertilizers depletes soil health by favoring the growth of certain microorganisms over others, thereby reducingmicrobial diversity, organic matter decomposition, leading to soil degradation.[84]In contrast, regenerative agriculture promotes practices that enhance soil health and nutrient cycling.[86]These practices include reduced tillage which helps to preserve SOM, the use oforganic fertilizerssuch as compost for soil enrichment, incorporating regenerative livestock management, practicing crop rotation with leguminous plants like soybean to promote nitrogen fixation that occurs from thesymbiotic relationshipbetween nitrogen-fixing bacteria and the root nodules.[87]Integrating livestock into cropping systems has been shown to improve nutrient cycling as animal manure enriches the soil and promotes microbial diversity.[88]Cover croppingis another practice that helps to prevent erosion, leading to healthier and more resilient soils.[89]\nConventional agricultural practices are generally understood to simplify agroecosystems through introduction of monocultures and eradication of diversity in soil microbial communities through chemical fertilization.[90]In natural ecosystems, biodiversity serves to regulate ecosystem function internally, but under conventional agricultural systems, such control is lost and requires increasing levels of external, anthropogenic input.[90]By contrast, regenerative agriculture practices including polycultures, mixed crop rotation, cover cropping, organic soil management, and low- or no-tillage methods have been shown to increase overall species diversity while reducing pest population densities.[90]Additionally, practices that favor organic over inorganic inputs aid in restoring below-ground biodiversity by enhancing the functioning of soil microbial communities.[67]A survey of organic and conventional farms in Europe found that on the whole, species across several taxa were higher in richness and/or abundance on organic farms compared to conventional ones, especially species whose populations have been demonstrably harmed as a direct result of conventional agriculture.[91]\nAMP grazing can help improve biodiversity since increased soil organic carbon stocks also promotes a diversity of soil microbial communities.[66]Implementation of AMP in North American prairies, for example, has been correlated with an increase in forage productivity and the restoration of plant species that had previously been decimated by continuous grazing practices.[66]Furthermore, studies of arid and semiarid regions of the world where regenerative grazing has been practiced for a long time following prior periods of continuous grazing have shown a recovery of biodiversity, grass species, and pollinator species.[66]Furthermore, crop diversification ensures that the agroecosystem remains productive when facing lower levels of soil fertility.[92]Higher levels of plant diversity led to increases in numerous factors that contribute to soil fertility, such as soil N, K, Ca, Mg, and C, in CEC and in soil pH.[93]\nUnited States\nThe

made by proponents of regenerative agriculture as exaggerated and unsupported by evidence.[94]\nOne of the prominent proponents of regenerative agriculture,Allan Savory, claimed in his TED talk that holistic grazing could reduce carbon-dioxide levels to pre-industrial levels in a span of 40 years. According toSkeptical Science:\n\"it is not possible to increase productivity, increase numbers of cattle and store carbon using any grazing strategy, never-mind Holistic Management [...] Long term studies on the effect of grazing on soil carbon storage have been done before, and the results are not promising.[...] Because of the complex nature of carbon storage in soils, increasing global temperature, risk ofdesertificationandmethane emissionsfrom livestock, it is unlikely that Holistic Management, or any management technique, can reverse climate change.[95]\"\nCommenting on his TED talk \"How to Fight Desertification and Reverse Climate Change\", Savory has since denied claiming that holistic grazing can reverse climate change, saying that \u201cI have only used the words address climate change\u2026 although I have written and talked about reversing man-made desertification\u201d.[96]Savory has faced criticisms for claiming the carbon sequestration potential of holistic grazing is immune from empirical scientific study.[96]For instance, in 2000, Savory said that \"the scientific method never discovers anything\" and \u201cthe scientific method protects us from cranks like me\".[97]A 2017 factsheet authored by Savory stated that \u201cEvery study of holistic planned grazing that has been done has provided results that are rejected by range scientists because there was no replication!\".[98]TABLE Debates sums this up by saying \"Savory argues that standardisation, replication, and therefore experimental testing of HPG [Holistic Planned Grazing] as a whole (rather than just the grazing system associated with it) is not possible, and that therefore, it is incapable of study by experimental science\", but \"he does not explain how HPG can make causal knowledge claims with regards to combating desertification and climate mitigation, without recourse to science demonstrating such connections.\"[96]\nAccording to a 2016 study published by theSwedish University of Agricultural Sciences, the actual rate at which improved grazing management could contribute to carbon sequestration is seven times lower than the claims made by Savory. The study concludes that holistic management cannot reverse climate change.[99]A study by the Food and Climate Research Network in 2017 concluded that Savory's claims about carbon sequestration are \"unrealistic\" and very different from those issued by peer-reviewed studies.[94]\nTim Searchinger and Janet Ranganathan have expressed concerns about emphasis upon \"Practices That Increase Soil Carbon at the Field Level\" because \"overestimating potential soil carbon gains could undermine efforts to advance effective climate mitigation in the agriculture sector.\"\u00a0Instead Tim Searchinger and Janet Ranganathan say, \"preserving the huge, existing reservoirs of vegetative and soil carbon in the world\u2019s remaining forests and woody savannas by boosting productivity on existing agricultural land (a land sparing strategy) is the largest, potential climate mitigation prize of regenerative and other agricultural practices. Realizing these benefits requires implementing practices in ways that boost productivity and then linking those gains to governance and finance to protect natural ecosystems. In short, produce, protect and prosper are the most important opportunities for agriculture.\"[100]", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsistence_agriculture": "Contents\nSubsistence agriculture\nHistory\nContemporary practices\nAdaptation to global warming\nTypes of subsistence farming\nShifting agriculture\nSedentary farming\nNomadic herding\nIntensive subsistence farming\nPoverty alleviation\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nSubsistence agricultureoccurs whenfarmersgrowcropsonsmallholdingsto meet the needs of themselves and their families.[1]Subsistence agriculturalists target farm output for survival and for mostly local requirements.

Many have important trade contacts and trade items that they can produce because of their special skills or special access to resources valued in the marketplace.[3]\nSubsistence farming today is most common indeveloping countries.[3]Subsistence agriculture generally features: small capital/finance requirements,mixed cropping, limited use of agrochemicals (e.g.pesticidesandfertilizer), unimproved varieties of crops and animals, little or no surplus yield for sale, use of crude/traditional tools (e.g. hoes, machetes, and cutlasses), mainly the production of crops, small scattered plots of land, reliance on unskilled labor (often family members), and (generally) low yields.\nSubsistence agriculture was the dominant mode of production in the world until recently,[when?]when market-basedcapitalismbecame widespread.[4]\nSubsistence agriculture largely disappeared in Europe by the beginning of the twentieth century.  It began to decrease in North America with the movement ofsharecroppersand tenant farmers out of the American South and Midwest during the 1930s and 1940s.[2][page\u00a0needed]In Central and Eastern Europe, semi-subsistence agriculture reappeared within thetransition economyafter 1990 but declined in significance (or disappeared) in most countries by the accession to the EU in 2004 or 2007.[5]\nSubsistence farming continues today in large parts of rural Africa,[6]and parts of Asia and Latin America.  In 2015, about 2 billion people (slightly more than 25% of the world's population) in 500 million households living in rural areas of developing nations survive as \"smallholder\" farmers, working less than 2hectares(5acres) of land.[7]Around 98% of China's farmers work on small farms, and China accounts for around half of the total world farms.[7]In India, 80% of the total farmers are smallholder farmers; Ethiopia and Asia have almost 90% being small; while Mexico and Brazil recorded 50% and 20% being small.[7]\nAreas where subsistence farming is largely practiced today, such as India and other regions in Asia, have seen a recent decline in the practice. This is due to processes such as urbanization, the transformation of land into rural areas, and integration of capitalist forms of farming.[8]In India, the increase in industrialization and decrease in rural agriculture has led to rural unemployment and increased poverty for those in lower caste groups. Those that are able to live and work in urbanized areas are able to increase their income while those that remain in rural areas take large decreases, which is why there was no large decline in poverty. \u00a0This effectively widens the income gap between lower and higher castes and makes it harder for those in rural areas to move up in caste ranking. This era has marked a time of increasedfarmer suicidesand the \"vanishing village\".[8]\nMost subsistence agriculture is practiced indeveloping countrieslocated intropical climates. Effects on crop production brought about byclimate changewill be more intense in these regions as extreme temperatures are linked to lower crop yields. Farmers have been forced to respond to increased temperatures through things such as increased land and labor inputs which threaten long-term productivity.[4]Coping measures in response to variable climates can include reducing daily food consumption and selling livestock to compensate for the decreased productivity. These responses often threaten the future of household farms in the following seasons as many farmers will sell draft animals used for labor and will also consume seeds saved for planting.[9]Measuring the full extent of future climate change impacts is difficult to determine as smallholder farms are complex systems with many different interactions. Different locations have different adaptation strategies available to them such as crop and livestock substitutions.[10]Rates of production for cereal crops, such as wheat, oats, and maize have been declining largely due to heat's effects on crop fertility.[11]This has forced many farmers to switch to moreheat tolerantcrops to maintain levels of productivity.[12]Substitution of crops for heat tolerant alternatives limits the overall diversity of crops grown on smallholder farms. As many farmers farm to meet daily food needs, this can negatively impact nutrition and diet among many families practicing subsistence agriculture.[13]\nWater availability has a crucial role in determining the productivity of subsistence agriculture, especially in dryland regions. Rain-needed farming, common in many areas, relies only on natural precipitation. Because of this, dryland farming is particularly susceptible to the ill effects of climate change in areas where weather patterns are already very erratic.doi:10.3390/atmos11121287\nIn this type of farming, a patch of forest land is cleared by a combination of felling (chopping down) and burning, and crops are grown. After two\u2013three years the fertility of the soil begins to decline, the land is abandoned and the farmer moves to clear a fresh piece of land elsewhere in the forest as the process continues.[14]While the land is left fallow the forest regrows in the cleared area andsoil fertilityandbiomassis restored. After a decade or more, the farmer may return to the first piece of land. This form of agriculture is sustainable at low population densities, but higher population loads require more frequent clearing which prevents soil fertility from recovering, opens up more of the forest canopy, and encourages scrub at the expense of large trees, eventually resulting indeforestationandsoil erosion.[15]Shifting cultivation is calleddreddin India,ladangin Indonesia andjhummingin North East India.\n[citation needed]While shifting agriculture's slash-and-burn technique may describe the method for opening new land, commonly the farmers in question have in existence at the same time smaller fields, sometimes merely gardens, near the homestead there they practice intensive \"non-shifting\" techniques. These farmers pair this with  \"slash and burn\" techniques to clear additional land and (by the burning) provide fertilizer (ash). Such gardens near the homestead often regularly receive household refuse. The manure of any household chickens or goats are initially thrown intocompostpiles just to get them out of the way. However, such farmers often recognize the value of such compost and apply it regularly to their smaller fields. They also may irrigate part of such fields if they are near a source of water.[citation needed]\nIn some areas of tropical Africa, at least, such smaller fields may be ones in which crops are grown on raised beds. Thus farmers practicing \"slash and burn\" agriculture are often much more sophisticated agriculturalists than the term \"slash and burn\" subsistence farmers suggests.\nIn this type of farming people migrate along with their animals from one place to another in search of fodder for their animals. Generally they rearcattle, sheep, goats, camels and/or yaks for milk, skin, meat and wool.[16]This way of life is common in parts of central and western Asia, India, east and southwest Africa and northern Eurasia. Examples are the nomadicBhotiyasandGujjarsof the Himalayas. They carry their belongings, such as tents, etc., on the backs of donkeys, horses, and camels.[17]In mountainous regions, like Tibet and the Andes, yak and llama are reared. Reindeer are the livestock in arctic and sub-arctic areas. Sheep, goats, and camels are common animals, and cattle and horses are also important.[16][18]\nIn intensive subsistence agriculture, the farmer cultivates a small plot of land using simple tools and more labour.[19]Climate with large number of days with sunshine and fertile soils, permits growing of more than one crop annually on the same plot. Farmers use their small land holdings to produce enough for their local consumption, while remaining produce is used for exchange against other goods. It results in much more food being produced per acre compared to other subsistence patterns. In the most intensive situation, farmers may even create terraces along steep hillsides to cultivate rice paddies.  Such fields are found in densely populated parts of Asia,such as in the Philippines. They may also intensify by using manure, artificial irrigation and animal waste asfertilizer. Intensive subsistence farming is prevalent in the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions of south, southwest, and southeast Asia.[19]\nSubsistence agriculture can be used as apoverty alleviationstrategy, specifically as a safety net for food-price shocks and forfood security. Poor countries are limited in fiscal and institutional resources that would allow them to contain rises in domestic prices as well as to manage social assistance programs, which is often because they are using policy tools that are intended for middle- and high-income countries.[20]Low-income countries tend to have populations in which 80% of poor are in rural areas. More than 90% of rural households have access to land, yet most of these poor have insufficient access to food.[20]Subsistence agriculture can be used in low-income countries as a part of policy responses to a food crisis in the short and medium term and provide a safety net for the poor in these countries.[20]\nAgriculture is\u00a0more successful than non-agricultural jobs in combating poverty in countries with a larger population of people without education or who are unskilled.[21]However, there are levels of poverty to be aware of to target agriculture towards the right audience.[22]Agriculture is better at reducing poverty in those that have an income of $1 per day than those that have an income of $2 per day in Africa.[22]People who make less income are more likely to be poorly educated and have fewer opportunities; therefore, they work more labor-intensive jobs, such as agriculture.[22]People who make $2 have more opportunities to work in less labor-intensive jobs in non-agricultural fields.[22]", "https://www.india.gov.in/topics/agriculture": "\nMost Searched\nAgriculture\nAgriculture\nMinister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare\nCabinet Minister\nWebsite\nImportant links\nMost Viewed\nWhat's New\nAgriculture, with its allied sectors, is unquestionably the largest livelihood provider in India, more so in the vast rural areas.

Agricultural education resources is provided by youth organizations, farm apprenticeships/internships, non-profit organizations, and government agencies/ministries. As well as agricultural workshops, trainings, shows, fairs, and research institutions. Online/distance learning programs are also available. In institutions, agricultural education serves as preparation for employment or careers in thefarming and agricultural sector.\nStudents learn about general principles ofland management,soil science,pasture management. As well as the principles ofagricultural economics, plant growth (plant physiology and how plants transport materials, reproduce and germinate), crop production (land preparation, cultivation of cash crops, crop selection, planting and maintenance), and protection (weed, pest and disease control, integrated pest management and the responsible use of farm chemicals). In addition to livestockanatomyandphysiology, production (livestock housing, nutrition and health management for the well-being of animals and optimal production), andbreeding.\nStudents who pursue higher education in colleges and universities are provided with more in-depth and focused education so that they can develop expertise in specialized areas such as animal science (physiology, nutrition, reproduction and health aspects of domesticated animals such as dairy cattle, sheep, poultry, etc.), food science (sustainable food, food safety, physiochemical and biological aspects of food, etc.), genetics (animal and plant genetics and genomics and their application in breeding and biotechnology), international agriculture (global perspective on internationalagribusiness, global food systems, water and energy issues, cropping systems in different regions), Farm business management (budgeting, marketing, planning and other skills necessary to manage the financial and business aspects of agricultural operations), sustainable and organic agriculture. Horticulture, turf grass management, small animal welfare, etc. can also be taught.\nThe main purposes of agricultural education encompass building a skilled agricultural workforce through training and preparation of future farmers and agricultural professionals, promotion of sustainable and responsible agricultural practices, enhancement of food security, development of cutting-edge agricultural technologists, innovators and leaders, improvement of awareness and understanding of agriculture to  bridge the gap between the source of food and the broader community of consumers, contribution to rural economic development and growth, and strengthening the connection between urban and rural agricultural communities.\nHistorically, farming techniques and knowledge were passed down through oral traditions. In 19th century, agricultural education was formalized as an academic discipline through the Morrill Acts in the United States. Over the years, it slowly subsumed a broad range of scientific subjects related to animals, plants and crops, soil, business, food, land, natural resources and environment.  In recent decades agricultural education has been adapted to address the issues of new technology, global perspectives and food security. Recent technological advancements discussed in agricultural education include the integration of precision agriculture, biotechnology, advanced machinery and data-driven approaches to optimize production, reduce resource wastage, improve overall efficiency, and minimize agriculture's ecological footprint. In the future, online learning, interdisciplinary research, community outreach and preparation for diverse career opportunities will also play a crucial role in addressing the evolving challenges of the agricultural sector.\nDisciplines closely tied to agricultural education include agricultural communications, agricultural leadership, and extension education.\nThe chief sources of agriculture education in the United States arehigh schools,community colleges, four-yearcollegesanduniversities, youth organizations, and the 10x15 program.\nThe rapid growth of agricultural education began during the late 19th century. In 1862, theUnited States Congresscreated the Department of Agriculture to gather and distribute agricultural information. TheMorrill Act, which provided the land-grant schools, became law that same year. TheHatch Act of 1887gave federal funds to establish agricultural experiment stations. The first dairy school in the U.S. was created at theUniversity of Wisconsin\u2013Madisonin 1891.[2]\nGovernment support for agricultural education has increased during the 20th century. For example, theSmith-Lever Actof 1914 created what is now the Cooperative Extension System (1988). TheSmith-Hughes Actof 1917 and the George-Barden Act of 1946 financed high-school instruction in farming.Woodlawn High School (Woodlawn, Virginia)was the first public high school in the United States to offer agricultural education classes under the Smith-Hughes Act.[3]The Vocational Education Act of 1963 funded training in other fields of agriculture.\nAgricultural science and education expanded after 1900 in response to a need for more technical knowledge and skill in the use of newly developed agricultural technologies. This development led to the use of modern farming methods that required fewer farmworkers, resulting in larger, corporatized farms and ranches. This development increased the need for more agriculture science and education.\nOther legislation influenced the development of agricultural education into what the field is today. It has developed throughout the last century from various laws and pieces of legislation.\nThe Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 required all public schools to provide a free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities. Under this provision, children with disabilities were now allowed to enroll in agricultural classes. TheAmericans with Disabilities Act, enacted in 1990, further required public schools to give students with disabilities equal opportunity for education to all other children in the country, and as a result, it increased opportunities for students with disabilities participate in agricultural classes.\nEducate America Act of 1994 raised benchmark standards for public education at the districts level, increasing curriculum and development requirements for all classes, including agricultural ones. The School-to-Work Opportunities Act, also of 1994, required teachers to teach students tasks and disciplines that would help their students prepare for employment once they graduated, of which practical education in agriculture was a major part. Finally,No Child Left Behind(Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 2001) further raised standards for students in public schools and increased requirements of teachers in order to reach these standards, affecting agricultural education as part of the general curriculum of many schools.[4]\nIn 2006,Walton Rural Life CenterinWalton, Kansaswas the first public elementary school in the United States to base its curriculum around agriculture.[5]Integrating agricultural components into the classroom is one of the challenges that elementary teachers face. They are also expected to teach with outdated teaching substances. John Block, who was a previous Secretary of Agriculture for the United States, encouraged agricultural competence.[6]Agriculture in the Classroom was one of Block's achievements to stress agricultural literacy in 1981. Agriculture in the Classroom soon became utilized in each state. Though Agriculture in the Classroom was the beginning of agriculture education in all fifty states, elementary instruction began in some schools possibly before the 1900s. After elementary agriculture education began to grow, twenty-one states began to require it by 1915. The required curriculum was evenly split between urban and rural schools. The states that required agricultural education at the elementary level were all midwestern states or southern states; both of which are rich in agriculture.[7]\nAgricultural education at the high school level focuses on three main categories: classroom instruction,supervised agricultural experience(SAE), and active involvement in theNational FFA Organization(Future Farmers of America).\nClassroom instruction of an agricultural class teaches the students the basic concepts of the particular course through hands on learning and experience. Students will be taught the information in the curriculum in order for them to understand and develop skills in the application and problem solving issues that would occur in an agricultural setting.[8]\nThe Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) portion of the agricultural curriculum is when a student must use the knowledge they have gained in the classroom instruction and use it in real life situations. Several topic choices are available for the student to choose between, whether it is on a farm setting, exploratory setting, entrepreneurship, agribusiness, or research projects. The student will choose a task from one of these topic areas and conduct a research experiment throughout the course of the agricultural class. The teacher is involved in the process and will help guide the student along the way. SAE programs give students the opportunity to take the information learned in the classroom setting and use it on an agricultural topic that interests them. This portion of an agricultural education will give students an idea of how it is working out in the real world and solving problems that will arise in the work field.[4]\nThe FFA is a national organization that all agricultural classes at the high school level are involved in. The agricultural teacher is the leader of that particular schools FFA chapter, and will guide students\u2019 activities and programs held throughout the year. FFA is an educational program designed to teach students leadership skills in both agricultural settings and everyday life, encourages personal growth in students, boosts self-confidence, builds character, encourage healthy lifestyles, and give students opportunities to be a part of the agricultural economy. FFA chapters will volunteer in communities, conduct banquets for FFA members and their families, raise awareness of agriculture, compete in FFA competitions, and attend national FFA conventions.[9]\nIn some states, the agriculture teacher leads a local Young Farmers Association in monthly meetings. The group may comprise local farmers, citizens, and anyone interested in learning about agriculture and new farming methods. The Young Farmers Association is designed to aid the adoption of agricultural technologies, and it gives agriculture teachers the opportunity to meet local citizens and reach out to the community.[8]\nLand-grant universitiesawarded more than three-quarters of all agricultural degrees in 1988. These state schools receive federal aid under legislation that followed theMorrill Actof 1862, which granted public lands to support agricultural or mechanical education. Land-grant universities have three chief functions: teaching, research, and outreach, or extension.\nAbachelor's degreein agricultural education generally leads to employment teaching agriculture up to the high school level or in the agricultural sector. Students are required to complete agriculture classes as well as education classes in order to become qualified to teach. Amaster's degreeis required in order to teach at the college level. TheAssociation for Career and Technical Education(ACTE), the largest national education association dedicated to the advancement of education that prepares youth and adults for careers, providesresources for agricultural education. An agricultural education degree also gives the qualifications to do extension work for universities and agricultural companies and organizations.[10]\nThe following universities provide pathways to complete certification requirements of their home states in secondary agricultural education:\nColleges of agriculture additionally prepare students for careers in all aspects of the food and agricultural system. Some career choices includefood science,veterinary science,farming,ranching,teaching,marketing,agricultural communication,management, andsocial services. Colleges and universities awarded about 21,000 bachelor's degrees in agriculture per year in 1988, and about 6,000 master's or doctor's degrees.\nEach land-grant university has an agricultural experiment station equipped with laboratories and experimental farms. There, agricultural scientists work to develop better farming methods, solve the special problems of local farmers, and provide new technology. Research published inscholarly journalsabout agricultural safety is available from theNIOSH-supportedNational Agricultural Safety Database. TheAmerican Dairy Science Associationprovides research and education scholarships focused on thedairyfarm and processing industries.\nTheCooperative Extension Systemis a partnership of the federal, state, and county governments. This service distributes information gathered by the land-grant universities and theU.S. Department of Agricultureto farmers, families, and young people. County extension agents, located in most countries (1988), train and support about 3 million (1988) volunteer leaders. Agents and volunteers carry out extension programs through meetings, workshops,newsletters,radio,television, and visits.\nProfessional organizations in the United States related to agricultural education include the American Association for Agricultural Education (AAAE), the Association for Career and Technical Education (ACTE), the National Association of Agricultural Educators (NAAE), and The National Council for Agricultural Education (The council).\n4H Club is considered a youth development program that teaches children about sciences, leadership, research, etc. 4H club has over 6 million members nationwide and is the largest youth development organization in the United States. 4H members use hands on learning to reach goals and help in communities.[12]Members of 4-H carry out group and individual projects dealing withconservation, food and agriculture,health and safety, and other subjects. The 4-H program in the United States is part of the Cooperative Extension service.\nSomewhat similarly, the FFA is a national organization that teaches students leadership skills and is designed to help members become more well rounded citizens in the agricultural field.[10]The FFA is an integral part of the program of agricultural education in many high schools as a result of Public Law 740 in 1950 (Currently revised as Public Law 105-225 of the 105th Congress of the United States), with 649,355 FFA members (2016\u20132017). Local chapters participate in Career Development Events (individually and as a team), each student has a Supervised Agricultural Experience program (SAE), and participates in many conferences and conventions to develop leadership, citizenship, patriotism and excellence in agriculture. The National FFA Organization is structured from the local chapter up, including local districts, areas, regions, state associations, and the national level. The FFA Mission is to make a positive difference in the lives of students by developing their potential for premier leadership, personal growth, and career success through agricultural education.\nThe history of agricultural education predates US activities and initially developed in Scottish, Italian and German colleges. The land grant approach of the USA owes much to the Scottish system in particular. Changes in higher agricultural education around the world today are highlighting implicit approaches that have hampered development and exceptional advances that have fed the world. the process has been described in one text (below) which takes a global perspective.\nAgricultural education in other countries resembles that in the United States. Canada has its own 4-H program.Agriculture Canadadistributes information on new farming methods and maintains experimental farms, research stations, and research institutions throughout the country.BC Agriculture in the Classroom Foundationoperates in the province ofBritish Columbia. In Australia, each state has several agricultural research stations and an extension service. Great Britain has a program of youth clubs calledYoung Farmer's Clubsthat resemble 4-H. TheFood and Agriculture Organizationof the United Nations works to train people throughout the world in modern farming methods. The United States gives technical assistance to farmers in developing nations through itsAgency for International Development(AID).\nTheGreen School Alliance (GSA)founded in 2007 has been working globally to expand its network of peer-to-peer Green Schools which focus on teaching sustainability and environmental education. It is a non-profit organization with free and voluntary membership. It has accrued 8,087 member schools from 48 states and 91 countries.[13]\nAs of February 2015Agriculture in Australiaemploys over 235,300 people in the agriculture, fishing and forestry and fishing industry. This industry alone equates to 12% share of the GDP earning close to $155 billion a year. The farmers own a combined 135,997 farms covering approximately 61% of the land mass.\nGiven these figures the agricultural programs in place in school and universities in very important to the future of the county. Several high schools operate across the country specifying in agriculture education. Predominantly these high schools are set in the rural areas with access to land. On the majority of cases the students often travel 1000\u00a0km to attend schools, taking up residence at the schools as boarders for the school term. One of the biggest in Australia isFarrer Memorial Agricultural High Schoolin central New South Wales.The Agriculture in Education programme launched by the Australian government in 2015 helps teachers better understand the products and processes associated with food and fibre production and gives students an opportunity to understand the importance of agriculture in the Australian economy. Topics covered by the materials include: designing and making a financial plan for a market garden, free range chicken farming, food security, and sustainable production practices in food and fibre.[14]The agricultural environment has changed enormously over the past 15 years, with greater emphasis on product quality issues, vertical integration from production to consumer, diversity in demand options, and environmental namely drought, welfare and ethical issues.[15]\nIn Western Australia, The Western Australian College of Agriculture is the primary provider of high schools in the state providing excellent educational opportunities at six campuses located near Cunderdin, Denmark, Esperance, Harvey, Morawa and Narrogin.[16]Each Campus has modern facilities on commercial sized farms and offers Year 10, 11 and 12 programs for male and female students. The students study a range of School Curriculum and Standards Authority subjects leading to Secondary Graduation and the Western Australian Certificate of Education and also complete vocational qualifications from Industry Training Packages. The major focus is on the study of agriculture but the program may also include horticulture, viticulture, equine, aquaculture, forestry, building construction, metals and engineering and automotive. Each Campus offers some specialist programs that can lead to tertiary study and apprenticeships and careers in a range of agriculture related vocations.[17]Tertiary studies located in Perth are available at Curtin University, Murdoch University and Muresk Institute offering degrees in Agriculture including Agricultural Business Management and Agricultural Science.Western Australian is in a precarious position and faces several challenges, fact that agriculture in Australia is affected by an ongoing shortage of labour and of skills. Labour supply is being adversely affected by an ageing workforce, retirements by baby boomers, seasonal nature of the lower skilled workforce and an inability to attract sufficient young people to work in the industry.[18]", "https://www.olamgroup.com/": "Locations\nAfrica\nAsia Pacific\nEurope\nLatin America\nNorth America\nMiddle East and North Africa\nGroup Sites\nCompany sites\nE-commerce\n\nOur Purpose\nGroup Overview\nBoard of Directors\nOur Leadership\nEthics & Compliance\nSustainability Framework\nFood Safety & Quality\nPriority Areas\nInnovation & Technology\nSustainable Supply Chains\nPolicies & Positions\nGrievance\nReporting\nAnnual Reports\nFinancials\nStrategy\nOur Re-organisation\nAnnouncements\nShareholder Centre\nGovernance\nOlam Group delivers 8.3% growth in EBIT, steady PATMI for H1 2024\nWe Are Re-imagining Global Agriculture\nRe-organising To Deliver Sharper Focus and Value\nCaring for the Communities That We Work With\nA Future at Olam: Imagine the Extraordinary\nLatest News\n\nofi prices US$65 million note via private placement\nofi secures JPY 46.5 billion medium-term samurai loan facility\nOlam Agri and Nutrifoods Support Akosombo Flood Victims\nBuilding a Business that Conserves Forests, One Step At a Time\nSubscribe to Our News Alerts\nSubscribe to Olam's Updates\nOlam Group\nFollow us:\nBlog\n\u00a9 2022 Olam Group All Rights Reserved Co.

This article treats the principles and practices of poultry farming. For a discussion of thefoodvalueand processing ofpoultryproducts,seeeggandpoultry processing.\nCommercial poultry feeding is a highly perfected science that ensures a maximum intake of energy for growth and fat production. High-quality and well-balancedproteinsources produce a maximum amount of muscle, organ, skin, andfeathergrowth. The essential minerals produce bones and eggs, with about 3 to 4 percent of the live bird being composed of minerals and 10 percent of the egg.Calcium,phosphorus,sodium,chlorine,potassium,sulfur,manganese,iron,copper,cobalt,magnesium, andzincare all required. VitaminsA,C,D,E, andKand all of theB vitaminsare also required.Antibioticsare widely used to stimulate appetite, control harmfulbacteria, and prevent disease. For chickens, modern rations produce about 0.5 kg (1 pound) of broiler on about 0.9 kg (2 pounds) of feed and a dozen eggs from 2 kg (4.5 pounds) of feed.\nA carefully controlledenvironmentthatavoidscrowding, chilling, overheating, or frightening is almost universal in poultry farming. Cannibalism, which expresses itself as toe picking, feather picking, and tail picking, is controlled by debeaking at one day of age and by other management practices. The feeding, watering, egg gathering, and cleaning operations are highly mechanized. Birds are usually housed in wire cages with two or three animals per cage, depending on the species and breed, and three or four tiers of cages superposed to save space. Cages for egg-laying birds have been found to increase production, lower mortality, reduce cannibalism, lower feeding requirements, reduce diseases andparasites, improveculling, and reduce both space and labour requirements.\nPoultry breedingis an outstanding example of the application of basic genetic principles ofinbreedingandcrossbreedingas well as of intensive mass selection to effect faster and cheaper gains in meat and maximum egg production for the egg-laying strains. Maximum use ofheterosis, or hybrid vigour, through incrosses and crossbreeding has been made. Rapid and efficient weight gains and high-quality, plump, meaty carcasses have been achieved thereby.\nAmong the world\u2019s agricultural industries,chickenbreeding in the U.S. is one of the most advanced. Intensive nutritional research and application, highly improved breeding stock, intelligent management, and scientific disease control have gone into the effort to give a modern broiler (meat chicken) of uniformly high quality produced at ever-lower cost. A modern broiler chick can reach a 2.3-kg (5-pound) market weight in five weeks, compared with the four months that were required in the mid-20th century. Additionally, annual egg production per hen has increased from about 100 in 1910 to over 300 in the early 21st century.\nPoultry are quitesusceptibleto a number of diseases. Some of the more common are fowl typhoid, pullorum, fowl cholera, chronicrespiratory disease, infectious sinusitis, infectious coryza, avian infectious hepatitis, infectious synovitis, bluecomb,Newcastle disease, fowl pox, avian leukosis complex,coccidiosis,blackhead, infectious laryngotracheitis, infectious bronchitis, anderysipelas. Strict sanitary precautions, the intelligent use of antibiotics andvaccines, and the widespread use of cages for layers and confinement rearing for broilers have made it possible to effect satisfactory disease control.\nOutbreaks ofbird flu, or avian influenza, which was first detected in humans in 1997, have led to the culling of millions of poultry animals since the late 20th century.Waterfowlsuch as wild\u00a0ducks\u00a0are thought to be primary hosts for all bird flu subtypes. Though normally resistant to theviruses, the birds carry them in their intestines and distribute them throughfecesinto the\u00a0environment, where they infect susceptible domestic birds. Sick birds pass the viruses to healthy birds throughsaliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Within a single region, bird flu istransmittedreadily from farm to farm by airborne feces-contaminated dust andsoil, by contaminated clothing, feed, and equipment, or by wild animals carrying theviruson their bodies. The disease is spread from region to region by migratory birds and through\u00a0international trade\u00a0in live poultry. Humans who are in close contact with sick birds\u2014for example, poultry farmers and slaughterhouse workers\u2014are at the greatest risk of becoming infected.\nParasitic diseases of poultry, including hexamitiasis of turkeys, are caused byroundworms,tapeworms,lice, andmites. Again, modern methods of sanitation, prevention, and treatment provide excellent control.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_agriculture": "Contents\nDigital agriculture\nHistorical context\nTechnology\nEffects of digital agriculture adoption\nEfficiency\nOn-farm efficiency\nOff-farm/market efficiency\nEquity\nFinancial inclusion\nMarket inclusion\nPotential inequities resulting from digital agriculture\nEnvironment\nEnabling environment\nDigital infrastructure\nAgriculture's role in the economy\nHuman capital\nPolicy and regulatory environment\nResearch environment\nSustainable Development Goals\nReferences\nExternal links\nDigital agriculture, sometimes known assmart farmingore-agriculture,[1]are tools that digitally collect, store, analyze, and share electronic data and/or information inagriculture. TheFood and Agriculture Organizationof the United Nations has described the digitalization process of agriculture as thedigital agricultural revolution.[2]Other definitions, such as those from the United Nations Project Breakthrough,[3]Cornell University,[4]and Purdue University,[5]also emphasize the role of digital technology in the optimization offood systems.\nDigital agriculture includes (but is not limited to)precision agriculture. Unlike precision agriculture, digital agriculture impacts the entire agri-food value chain \u2014 before, during, and after on-farm production.[6]Therefore, on-farm technologies likeyield mapping,GPS guidance systems, andvariable-rate application, fall under the domain of precision agricultureanddigital agriculture. On the other hand, digital technologies involved in e-commerce platforms, e-extension services, warehouse receipt systems, blockchain-enabled food traceability systems, tractor rental apps, etc. fall under the umbrella of digital agriculture but not precision agriculture.\nEmerging digital technologies have the potential to be game-changers for traditional agricultural practices. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has referred to this change as a revolution: \"a 'digital agricultural revolution' will be the newest shift which could help ensure agriculture meets the needs of the global population into the future.\"[2]Other sources label the change as \"Agriculture 4.0,\" indicating its role as the fourth major agricultural revolution.[7]Precise dates of the Fourth Agricultural Revolution are unclear. TheWorld Economic Forumannounced that the \"Fourth Industrial Revolution\" (which includes agriculture) will unfold throughout the 21st century, so perhaps 2000 or shortly thereafter marks the beginning of Agriculture 4.0.[8][9]\nAgricultural revolutions denote periods of technological transformation and increased farm productivity.[10]Agricultural revolutions include theFirst Agricultural Revolution, theArab Agricultural Revolution, theBritish/Second Agricultural Revolution, theScottish Agricultural Revolution, and theGreen Revolution/Third Agricultural Revolution. Despite boosting agricultural productivity, past agricultural revolutions left many problems unsolved. For example, the Green Revolution had unintended consequences, like inequality and environmental damage. First, the Green Revolution exacerbated inter-farm and interregional inequality,[11]typically biased toward large farmers with the capital to invest in new technologies.[12]Second, critics say its policies promoted heavy input use and dependence on agrochemicals, which led to adverse environmental effects likesoil degradationand chemical runoff.[13][14]Digital agriculture technologies have the potential to address negative side effects of the Green Revolution.\nIn some ways, the Digital Agriculture Revolution follows patterns of previous agricultural revolutions. Scholars forecast a further shift away from labor, a slight shift away from capital, and intensified use ofhuman capital\u2014 continuing the trend the British Agricultural Revolution started.[15][16]Also, many predict that social backlash \u2014 possibly around the use of artificial intelligence or robots \u2014 will arise with the fourth revolution.[17][18][19][20]Since controversy accompanies every societal transformation, the digital agricultural revolution isn't new in that respect.\nIn other ways, the Digital Agriculture Revolution is distinct from its predecessors. First, digital technologies will affectallparts of the agricultural value chain, including off-farm segments.[21][22]This differs from the first three agricultural revolutions, which primarily impacted production techniques and on-farm technologies. Second, a farmer's role will require more data analytics skills and less physical interaction with livestock/fields.[23][24][22][25]Third, although farming has always relied on empirical evidence, the volume of data and the methods of analysis will undergo drastic changes in the digital revolution.[16][26]For example, Smart farm systems continuously monitor the behavior of your animals. Giving you insight into their behavior every moment of the day.[27]Finally, increased reliance onbig datamay increase the power differential between farmers and information service providers,[21][28]or between farmers and large value chain actors (like supermarkets).[21]\nDigital agriculture encompasses a wide range of technologies, most of which have multiple applications along the agricultural value chain. These technologies include, but are not limited to:\nThe FAO estimates the world will need to produce 56% more food (as compared to 2010, under \"business as usual\" growth) to feed over 9 billion in 2050.[31][32]Furthermore, the world faces intersecting challenges like malnutrition, climate change,food waste, and changing diets.[33]To produce a \"sustainable foodfuture,\" the world must increase food production while cuttinggreenhouse gas emissionsand maintaining (or reducing) the land used in agriculture.[34]Digital agriculture could address these challenges by making the agricultural value chain more efficient, equitable, and environmentally sustainable.\nDigital technology changes economic activity by lowering the costs of replicating, transporting, tracking, verifying, and searching for data.[35]Due to these falling costs, digital technology will improve efficiency throughout the agricultural value chain.\nOn-farm, precision agriculture technologies can minimize inputs required for a given yield. For example,variable-rate application(VRA) technologies can apply precise amounts of water, fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide, etc. A number of empirical studies find that VRA improves input use efficiency.[36][37][38]Using VRA alongside geo-spatial mapping, farmers can apply inputs to hyper-localized regions of their farm \u2014 sometimes down to the individual plant level. Reducing input use lowers costs and lessens negative environmental impacts. Furthermore, empirical evidence indicates precision agriculture technologies can increase yields.[39]On U.S. peanut farms, guidance systems are associated with a 9% increase in yield, and soil maps are associated with a 13% increase in yield.[40][41]One study in Argentina found that a precision agriculture approach based on crop physiological principles could result in 54% higher farm output.[42]\nDigital agriculture can improve the allocative efficiency of physical capital within and between farms. Often touted as \"Uber for tractors,\" equipment-sharing platforms like Hello Tractor,[43][44]WeFarmUp,[45][46]MachineryLink Solutions,[47]TroTro Tractor, and Tringo[48]facilitate farmer rental of expensive machinery. By facilitating a market for equipment sharing, digital technology ensures fewer tractors sit idle and allows owners to make extra income. Furthermore, farmers without the resources to make big investments can better access equipment to improve their productivity.\nDigital agriculture improves labor productivity through improved farmer knowledge. E-extension (electronic provision of traditionalagricultural extensionservices) allows for farming knowledge and skills to diffuse at low cost. For example, the company Digital Green works with local farmers to create and disseminate videos about agricultural best practices in more than 50 languages.[49][50]E-extension services can also improve farm productivity via decision-support services on mobile apps or other digital platforms. Using many sources of information \u2014 weather data, GIS spatial mapping, soil sensor data, satellite/drone pictures, etc. \u2014 e-extension platforms can provide real-time recommendations to farmers. For example, the machine-learning-enabled mobile appPlantix,Krisikart Indiadiagnoses crops' diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies based on a smartphone photo.[51]In a randomized control trial, Casaburi et al. (2014) found that sugarcane growers who received agricultural advice via SMS messages increased yields by 11.5% relative to the control group.[52]\nFinally, digital agriculture improves labor productivity through decreased labor requirements. Automation inherent in precision agriculture \u2014 from \"milking robots on dairy farms to greenhouses with automated climate control\"[53]\u2014 can make crop and livestock management more efficient by reducing required labor.[54][55]\nBesides streamlining farm production, digital agriculture technologies can make agricultural markets more efficient. Mobile phones, online ICTs, e-commerce platforms, digital payment systems, and other digital agriculture technologies can mitigate market failures and reduce transaction costs throughout the value chain.\nRarely does one single digital agriculture technology solve one discrete market failure. Rather, systems of digital agriculture technologies work together to solve multifaceted problems. For example, e-commerce solves two efficiency issues: difficulty matching buyers and sellers, especially in rural areas, and the high transaction costs associated with in-person, cash-based trade.\nDigital agriculture shows promise for creating a more equitable agri-food value chain. Because digital technologies reduce transaction costs and information asymmetries, they can improve smallholder farmers' market access in a number of ways:\nDigital agriculture technologies can expand farmers' access to credit, insurance, and bank accounts for a number of reasons. First, digital technology helps alleviate the information asymmetry that exists between farmers and financial institutions. When lenders decide a farmer's credit ceiling or insurance premium, they are usually uncertain about what risks the farmer presents. Digital technology reduces the costs of verifying farmers' expected riskiness. The Kenyan company M-Shwari uses customers' phone and mobile money records to assess creditworthiness.[73]Organizations like FarmDrive and Apollo Agriculture incorporate satellite imagery, weather forecasts, and remote sensor data when calculating farmers' loan eligibility.[74][75]Drone imagery can confirm a farmer's physical assets or land use[76]and RFID technology allows stakeholders to monitor livestock,[77]making it easier for insurers to understand farmers' riskiness. In all instances, low-cost digital verification reduces lenders' uncertainty: the questions \"will this farmer repay the loan?\" and \"what risks does this farmer face?\" become clearer.\nSecond, digital technology facilitates trust between farmers and financial institutions. A range of tools create trust, including real-time digital communication platforms and blockchain/distributed ledger technology/smart contracts. In Senegal, a digitalized, supply-chain-tracking system allows farmers to collateralize their rice to obtain the credit necessary for planting. Lenders accept rice as collateral because real-time, digital tracking assures them the product was not lost or damaged in the post-harvest process.[78]\nMiddlemen often extract exorbitant rents from farmers when purchasing their harvest or livestock for several reasons. First, smallholders in remote areas may be unaware of fair market prices. As a result, middlemen (who typically have better information about market conditions and prices) accrue significant market power and profits.[79]A study conducted in the central highlands of Peru found that farmers who received market price information via mobile phone SMS increased their sales prices by 13-14% relative to farmers without access to the information.[80]Second, smallholders produce tiny harvests compared to large producers, so they lack bargaining power with middlemen. If smallholders can aggregate or form a cooperative to sell their products together, they have more leverage. Online platforms and mobile phones can facilitate aggregation, such asDigital Green's Loop app.[81]Third, connecting producers with final consumers can eliminate intermediaries' monopsony power, thereby raising producer profits.[57]As mentioned above in the efficiency section, e-commerce or other market linkage platforms can connect a small farmer directly to consumers around the world.\nThough digital technologies can facilitate market access and information flow, there's no guarantee they won't exacerbate existing inequalities. Should constraints prevent a range of farmers from adopting digital agriculture, it's possible that the benefits will only accrue to the powerful.\nBoosting natural resource efficiency is the \"single most important need for a sustainable food future,\" according to the World Resource Institute.[34]As mentioned in the on-farm efficiency section, precision farming \u2014 including variable rate nutrient application, variable rate irrigation, machine guidance, and variable rate planting/seeding \u2014 could minimize use of agricultural inputs for a given yield.[93][94]This could mitigate resource waste and negative environmental externalities,[95]like greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,[94]soil erosion,[96]and fertilizer runoff.[39]For example, Katalin et al. 2014 estimate that switching to precision weed management could save up to 30,000 tons of pesticide in the EU-25 countries.[97]Gonz\u00e1lez-Dugo et al. 2013 found that precision irrigation of a citrus orchard could reduce water use by 25 percent while maintaining a constant yield.[98]Basso et al. 2012 demonstrated that variable-rate application of fertilizer can reduce nitrogen application and leaching without affecting yield and net return.[99]\nHowever, precision agriculture could also accelerate farms' depletion of natural resources because of arebound effect; increasing input efficiency does not necessarily lead to resource conservation.[100]Also, by changing economic incentives, precision agriculture may hinder environmental policies' effectiveness: \"Precision agriculture can lead to higher marginal abatement costs in the form of forgone profits, decreasing producers' responsiveness to those policies.\"[100]In other words, holding pollution constant, precision agriculture allows a farmer to produce more output \u2014 thus, abatement becomes more expensive.\nOff-farm, digital agriculture has the potential to improve environmental monitoring and food system traceability. The monitoring costs of certifying compliance with environmental, health, or waste standards are falling because of digital technology.[101]For example, satellite and drone imagery can track land use and/or forest cover; distributed ledger technologies can enable trusted transactions and exchange of data; food sensors can monitor temperatures to minimize contamination during storage and transport.[51]Together, technologies like these can form digital agriculture traceability systems, which allow stakeholders to track agri-food products in near-real-time. Digital traceability yields a number of benefits, environmental and otherwise:\nAccording to theMcKinseyIndustry Digitization Index, the agricultural sector is the slowest adopter of digital technologies in the United States.[105]Farm-level adoption of digital agriculture varies within and between countries, and uptake differs by technology. Some characterize precision agriculture uptake as rather slow.[106]In the United States in 2010-2012, precision agriculture technologies were used on 30-50% of corn and soybean acreage.[82]Others point out that uptake varies by technology \u2014 farmer use of GNSS guidance has grown rapidly, but variable-rate technology adoption rarely exceeds 20% of farms.[107]Furthermore, digital agriculture is not limited to on-farm precision tools, and these innovations typically require less upfront investment. Growing access to ICTs in agriculture and a booming e-commerce market all bode well for increased adoption of digital agriculture downstream of the farm.[51]\nIndividual farmers' perceptions about usefulness, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness impact the spread of digital agriculture.[108]In addition, a number of broader factors enable the spread of digital agriculture, including:\nAlthough a few digital technologies can operate in areas with limited mobile phone coverage and internet connectivity, rural network coverage plays an important role in digital agriculture's success.[51][109]A wide gap exists between developed and developing countries' 3G and 4G cellular coverage, and issues like dropped calls, delays, weak signals, etc. hamper telecommunications efficacy in rural areas.[110]Even when countries overcome infrastructural challenges, the price of network connectivity can exclude smallholders, poor farmers, and those in remote areas. Similar accessibility and affordability issues exist for digital devices and digital accounts. According to a 2016 GSMA report, of the 750 million-plus farmers in the 69 surveyed countries, about 295 million had a mobile phone; only 13 million had both a mobile phone and a mobile money account.[111]Despite lingering gaps in network coverage, ICT access has skyrocketed in recent years. In 2007, only 1% of people in developing countries used Internet, but by 2015, 40% did. Mobile-broadband subscriptions, which increased thirty-fold between 2005 and 2015, drove much of this growth.[112]As a key enabler of agricultural change, digital infrastructure requires further development, but growing ICT access indicates progress.\nThe significance and structure of a country's agricultural sector will affect digital agriculture adoption. For example, a grain-based economy needs difference technologies than a major vegetable producer. Automated, digitally-enabled harvesting systems might make sense for grains, pulses and cotton, but only a few specialty crops generate enough value to justify large investments in mechanized or automated harvesting.[55]Farm size also affects technology choices, as economies of scale make large investments possible[110](e.g., adoption of precision agriculture is more likely on larger farms).[82]On the other hand, digital agriculture solutions focused on ICTs and e-commerce would benefit an economy dominated by smallholders. In China, where the average farm size is less than 1 ha,[113]Alibaba's customer-to-customer e-commerce platform called Rural Taobao has helped melon growers in Bachu County market their produce all over the country.[110]Other structural factors, such as percent of the population employed in agriculture, farm density, farm mechanization rates, etc. also impact how difference regions adopt digital agriculture.\nIn order to benefit from the advent of digital agriculture, farmers must develop new skills. As Bronson (2018) notes, \"training a rural work-force in Internet technology skills (e.g., coding) is obviously a key part of agricultural \"modernization.\"[16]Integration into the digital economy requires basic literacy (ability to read) and digital literacy (ability to use digital devices to improve welfare). In many instances, benefiting from digital content also requires English literacy or familiarity with another widely spoken language.[114]Digital agriculture developers have designed ways around these barriers, such as ICTs with audio messages[49]and extension videos in local languages.[50]However, more investment in human capital development is needed to ensure all farmers can benefit from digital agriculture.\nFostering human capital in the form of innovation also matters for the spread of digital agriculture.[51]Some characterize digital agriculture innovation, a knowledge- and skills-intensive process, as concentrated in \"Big Ag\" companies and research universities.[115]However, others describe small-scale entrepreneurs as the \"heart of the action.\"[21]In 2018, ag-tech innovation attracted $1.9 billion in venture capital, and the sector has grown significantly in the last 10 years.[116]Although digital agriculture may be concentrated in a few developed countries because of \"structure, institutional, and economic barriers,\"[115]ag-tech startups have experienced significant growth in Africa,[117][118][119]the Caribbean and Pacific,[120]Asia,[110]and Latin America as well.\nIn order for digital agriculture to spread, national governments, multilateral organizations, and other policymakers must provide a clear regulatory framework so that stakeholders feel confident investing in digital agriculture solutions. Policy designed for the pre-Internet era prevents the advancement of \"smart agriculture,\"[121]as does regulatory ambiguity.[6]Furthermore, a blurry line between personal and business data when discussing family farms complicates data regulation.[122]The unanswered regulatory questions mostly concernbig data, and they include:\nBesides establishing regulations to boost stakeholder confidence, policymakers can harness digital agriculture for the provision of public goods. First, the United Nations' Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) calls for open access to agricultural data as a basic right.[128]Rather than stakeholders operating in \"data silos\" \u2014 where no one shares information for fear of competition \u2014 open data sources (when appropriately anonymized) can foster collaboration and innovation.[21]Open-sourced data can rebalance the power asymmetry between farmers and large agribusinesses who collect data.[28]Second, governments can finance research and development of digital agriculture. Forbig dataanalytics tools \"to enter the public domain, work for the common good and not just for corporate interests, they need to be funded and developed by public organizations.\"[28][16]The United Kingdom,[129]Greece,[130]and other national governments have already announced large investments in digital agriculture. Governments can also engage in private-public R&D partnerships to foster smallholder-oriented digital agriculture projects in developing countries.[112]Lastly, digital agriculture technologies \u2014 particularly traceability systems \u2014 can improve monitoring of environmental compliance, evaluation of subsidy eligibility, etc.[51]\nFinally, when governments and international undertake complementary investments, they can strengthen the enabling environment for digital agriculture. By improving digital infrastructure, choosing digital agriculture technologies appropriate for the regional context, and investing in human capital/digital skills development, policymakers could support digital agriculture.[51]\nIn the United States, research in digital agriculture is primarily funded by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA)[131]which comes under theUS Department of Agricultureand to a lesser extent, by theNational Science Foundation.[132]Two large institutes applying IoT or artificial intelligence in digital agriculture have been unveiled by these funding organizations working together.\nAccording to Project Breakthrough, digital agriculture can help advance the United NationsSustainable Development Goalsby providing farmers with more real-time information about their farms, allowing them to make better decisions. Technology allows for improved crop production by understandingsoil health. It allows farmers to use fewerpesticideson their crops. Soil and weather monitoring reduces water waste. Digital agriculture ideally leads to economic growth by allowing farmers to get the most production out of their land. The loss of agricultural jobs can be offset by new job opportunities in manufacturing and maintaining the necessary technology for the work. Digital agriculture also enables individual farmers to work in concert, collecting and sharing data using technology.[135]and The hope is that young people want to become digital farmers[136]", "https://www.ecozensolutions.com/": "ecotron\necofrost\nbuilding asmart +sustainablefuture\nEver Impacting Technology\n82K+ FARMERS DIRECTLY IMPACTED\n315MN L DIESEL SAVED\n19K+ MT PERISHABLE WASTAGE REDUCED\n945MN KWH CLEAN ENERGY GENERATED\nEver Impacting Technology\nwe\u2019re driven to be at theheartof sustainable tech.\nOur Solutions\nOur Happy Customers\nEcozen in the news\nGet in touch with us\n\nToll Free number:1800 121 7515\nPumping  A New Lease of Life\nThe Next-Gen Solar Pump Controller System\nLonger Shelf Life, Bigger Profits\nThe Efficient Solar Cold Room\nThe next at Ecozen is coming\nHow we\u2019ve improved countless lives\nHow we\u2019ve improved countless lives\necofrostinstalled in Orissa, India\nPreserving what\u2019s precious.\nInnovation that powers green tech.\nEcotron\nPumps &Motors\nThe smart solar pump controller system that provides reliable and optimal irrigation without worrying about power cuts or any maintenance related issues.\nEcofrost\nLink\nThe innovative Solar Cold Storage Solution that reduces wastage of your produce using clean energy, powered by our unique Ice Core Technology.\nWe are evolving for the greater good\nOur tech platform is now open for industry-agnostic motor controls, electric vehicles and devices across manufacturing & more.\nThoroughly satisfied with the timely installation\nof Ecofrost.

Other names used to designate the profession includeagricultural scientist, agricultural manager, agricultural planner, agriculture researcher, oragriculture policy maker.\nThe primary role of agriculturists are in leading agricultural projects and programs, usually inagribusiness planningor research for the benefit offarms, food, andagribusiness-related organizations.[2]Agriculturists usually are designated in the government as public agriculturists serving as agriculture policymakers or technical advisors for policy making.[3]Agriculturists can also provide technical advice forfarmersandfarm workerssuch as in makingcrop calendarsandworkflowsto optimize farm production, tracingagricultural marketchannels,[4]prescribingfertilizersandpesticidestoavoid misuse,[5]and in aligning fororganic accreditation[6]or the nationalagricultural quality standards.[7]\nPreparation oftechnical engineering designs and constructionfor agriculture meanwhile are reserved foragricultural engineers.[8]Agriculturists may pursueenvironmental planningand focus on agricultural and rural planning.[9]\nAgriculturists are science basedconsultantswith major fields of specialization includingagribusiness management,crop science,agricultural extension,agriculture economics,development communication,animal science,soil science,food technology,crop protection,agricultural biotechnology,agricultural policy, andenvironmental science.\nIn modern practice, agriculturists are expected to be proficient indigital agriculturesuch as the use ofgeographic information systems,artificial intelligence, andremote sensingfor better agricultural planning.\nAgriculturists of today are involved with many issues, including producing food, creating healthier food, managing theenvironmental impact of agriculture, distribution of agriculture, recreation surfaces (sports fields, golf courses, and parks), and extractingenergyfrom plants.[10]\nAgriculturists often specialize in food and agriculture research areas such ascrop rotation,irrigationanddrainage,plant breeding,plant physiology,soil classification,soil fertility,weed control,turfgrassand insect andpest control.\nProfessional agriculturists may provide advice directly to farmers, vineyards, agricultural corporations, municipal and provincial governments, the fertilizer and seeds sector, consult on food processing, advise onrange management,turf managementand golf course operations, assess and provide remedial recommendations forbrown lands(contaminated sites), watersheds, among many different areas of practice.\nIn India, the professional designation isAgricultural Scientist(abbreviated asARS). To qualify for entry level posts, theAgricultural Scientists Recruitment Boardconducts competitive examinations pursuant to the Gajendragadkar Report of 1972.[11]The post of entry level ARS is same with Jr. Class I cadre of Central government. The initial pay is fixed after granting advance increments for higher qualification, with PhDs getting the highest salary.\nThey are kept on 'tenure track' or 'probation' for two years and upon satisfactory completion of this period they are given tenure and confirmed in the ARS. On completing service for designated years and meeting set performance criteria, they are promoted to the next higher grades in a flexible complementation system known as Career Advancement Scheme (CAS).\nIncumbents without a PhD degree are given paid study leave to acquirePhDqualification, which is necessary for career progression. Through CAS, scientists can rise up to principal scientist grade, which is equivalent to the scale of joint secretary to theGovernment of India. The ARS encourages fresh infusion of talent at all senior levels throughlateral entryin which incumbent scientists can participate in the open competition and move their career ahead in much shorter time than CAS. All the research management positions are filled through open competition. The director general of ICAR is the highest-ranked member of the ARS, who isex officiosecretaryto the Government of India, Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE),Ministry of Agriculture.\nIn the Philippines, the official professional designation isLicensed and Registered Agriculturist[12]but is more commonly shortened as \"Licensed Agriculturist\" or more simply as \"Agriculturist\". They are licensed and accredited after successfully passing the Agriculturist Licensure Examination, regulated by theProfessional Regulation Commissionand the Board of Agriculture.[13]A Licensed Agriculturist can affix the title \"L.Agr.\" (as name suffix) or \"Agr.\" (as name prefix) to indicate the profession.[14]\nThe primary role of agriculturists are to prepare technical plans, specifications, and estimates of agriculture projects such as in the construction and management offarmsandagribusiness enterprises.[2]The practice of agriculture also includes the following:\nA prospective professional agriculturist is typically required to have a four-yearBachelor of Science degreein Agriculture, although other degree programs directly related to agriculture are also allowed to take the licensure examination if they earn at least eighteen (18) units of agriculture credits from a recognized higher education institution.[15]About 5,500 registered agriculturists pass the licensure examination annually.[16]It is one of the hardest licensure examinations in the country with 29.84% passing rate in November 2021.[17][18]\nThe agriculturist profession and its board of agriculturists were created in 2002 by theProfessional Regulation Commission,[15]in order to \"upgrade the agriculture and fisheries profession\"[19]by the virtue of theAgriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997. The practice of the agriculture profession is a professional service admission. Similar to other professions in the Philippines, malpractice and illegal practice of agriculture are grounds for suspension or revocation of certificates of registration and professional licenses.[20]Licensed agriculturists in the Philippines are integrated into one accredited integrated professional organization, which is the Philippine Association of Agriculturists.\nIn the European Union, the generic name of the profession is Agronomist/Agricultural Engineer.[21]The profession is exercised for the public interest in defense of the principles of theCharter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union[22]andDirective 2005/36/EC.[23]\nIn Italy, the professional designation is \"Dottori Agronomi\" (translated asAgronomy Doctor). The profession is exercised for the public interest in defense of the principles of Articles 9 and 32 of the Italian Constitution and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Professionals enrolled in the Register of Dottori Agronomi while exercising the profession base their actions on the following principles:\nIn Canada, the professional designation is \"agrologist\", also called \"agronome\" inQu\u00e9bec. There are more than 10,000 professional agrologists andagronomesin Canada.[24]\nProfessional agrologists are accredited through provincial regulatory bodies, e.g. Saskatchewan Institute of Agrology, Nova Scotia Institute of Agrologists. The requirements to attain professional designation (PAg) are similar in each province. A prospective agrologist is typically required to have a four-year undergraduatescience degreedirectly related to agrology.  If accepted by their provincial institute, the applicant is known as an articling agrologist (AAg) or agrologist-in-training (AIT) and must complete a two-year educational and mentorship program before being considered for a professional designation.\nAn alternative certification called \"registered technical agrologist\" (RTag), or (PTag) is also available, requiring a two-year college or university education in the agricultural sciences instead of a four-year degree. These technologists designations require a two-year mentorship and education program, and participate in the same mentorship processes as a professional agrologist.\nIn the United States, the professional designation is Certified ProfessionalAgronomist(abbreviatedC.PAg), theAmerican Society of Agronomyis the regulatory organization responsible for certification.[25]The American Society of Agronomy uses a sliding scale of education and experience to determine certification: it is required to have either abachelor's degreein science and 5 years work experience, amaster's degreerelated to agrology and 3 years work experience, or aDoctoraterelated to agrology and a single year of work experience.[26]CPAgs are required to complete at least 50 hours ofcontinuing educationthrough the American Society of Agronomy every two years in order to retain their certification.\nThe American Society of Agronomy also provides certifications for Certified Crop Advisors (CCA).[26]To become a Certified Crop Adviser an applicant must pass two exams that may both be written on the same day at the same location. \u00a0The International exam is written by CCAs in North America. The Prairie region exam is written by individuals wishing to work as advisers in the three Prairie provinces of Canada or in the heartland states of the US.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_agriculture": "Contents\nPrecision agriculture\nHistory\nOverview\nPrescriptive planting\nPrinciples\nGeolocating\nVariables\nStrategies\nImplementing practices\nUsage around the world\nEconomic and environmental impacts\nEmerging technologies\nRobots\nDrones and satellite imagery\nThe Internet of things\nSmartphone applications\nMachine learning\nConferences\nSee also\nSources\nNotes\nExternal links\n\nPrecision agriculture(PA) is a management strategy that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial and individual plant and animal data and combines it with other information to support management decisions according to estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability and sustainability of agricultural production.\u201d[2]It is used in both crop andlivestock production.[3]Precision agriculture often employs technologies toautomate agricultural operations, improving their diagnosis, decision-making or performing.[4][5]The goal of precision agriculture research is to define adecision support systemfor whole farm management with the goal of optimizing returns on inputs while preserving resources.[6][7]\nAmong these many approaches is aphytogeomorphologicalapproach which ties multi-year crop growth stability/characteristics to topological terrain attributes. The interest in the phytogeomorphological approach stems from the fact that thegeomorphologycomponent typically dictates thehydrologyof the farm field.[8][9]\nThe practice of precision agriculture has been enabled by the advent ofGPSandGNSS. The farmer's and/or researcher's ability to locate their precise position in a field allows for the creation of maps of the spatial variability of as many variables as can be measured (e.g. crop yield, terrain features/topography, organic matter content, moisture levels, nitrogen levels, pH, EC, Mg, K, and others).[10]Similar data is collected bysensor arraysmounted on GPS-equippedcombine harvesters. These arrays consist of real-time sensors that measure everything from chlorophyll levels to plant water status, along withmultispectralimagery.[11]This data is used in conjunction withsatellite imageryby variable rate technology (VRT) including seeders, sprayers, etc. to optimally distribute resources. However, recent technological advances have enabled the use of real-time sensors directly in soil, which can wirelessly transmit data without the need of human presence.[12][13][14]\nPrecision agriculture can benefit fromunmanned aerial vehicles, that are relatively inexpensive and can be operated by novice pilots.  Theseagricultural drones[15]can be equipped with multispectral or RGB cameras to capture many images of a field that can be stitched together usingphotogrammetricmethods to createorthophotos. Thesemultispectral imagescontain multiple values per pixel in addition to the traditional red, green blue values such as near infrared and red-edge spectrum values used to process and analyze vegetative indexes such asNDVImaps.[16]These drones are capable of capturing imagery and providing additional geographical references such as elevation, which allows software to perform map algebra functions to build precise topography maps. These topographic maps can be used to correlate crop health with topography, the results of which can be used to optimize crop inputs such as water, fertilizer or chemicals such as herbicides and growth regulators through variable rate applications.\nPrecision agriculture education\nEveryone in the agricultural industry, including teachers, is still getting their feet wet with precision agriculture technologies. Precision agriculture has led many to believe that industry-related technologies should lead research and education instead of the other way around. In classrooms, conferences, workshops, and field days, educators of precision agriculture have struggled to keep up with the number of questions being asked. Training people to use precision agriculture technologies has proven difficult, in contrast to teaching the fundamental ideas and concepts, which have been intuitive and rather straightforward.[17]\nPrecision agriculture is a key component of the third wave of modernagricultural revolutions.  The first agricultural revolution was the increase ofmechanized agriculture, from 1900 to 1930. Each farmer produced enough food to feed about 26 people during this time.[18]The 1960s prompted theGreen Revolutionwith new methods of genetic modification, which led to each farmer feeding about 156 people.[18]It is expected that by 2050, the global population will reach about 9.6 billion, and food production must effectively double from current levels in order to feed every mouth. With new technological advancements in the agricultural revolution of precision farming, each farmer will be able to feed 265 people on the same acreage.[18]\nThe first wave of the precision agricultural revolution came in the forms of satellite and aerial imagery, weather prediction, variable rate fertilizer application, and crop health indicators.[19]The second wave aggregates the machine data for even more precise planting, topographical mapping, and soil data.[20]\nPrecision agriculture aims to optimize field-level management with regard to:\nPrecision agriculture also provides farmers with a wealth of information to:\nPrescriptive plantingis a type of farming system that delivers data-driven planting advice that can determine variable planting rates to accommodate varying conditions across a single field, in order to maximize yield. It has been described as \"Big Dataon the farm.\"Monsanto,DuPontand others are launching this technology in the US.[21][22]\nPrecision agriculture uses many tools but here are some of the basics: tractors, combines, sprayers, planters, diggers, which are all considered auto-guidance systems. The small devices on the equipment that uses GIS (geographic information system) are what makes precision agriculture what it is. You can think of the GIS system as the \u201cbrain.\u201d To be able to use precision agriculture the equipment needs to be wired with the right technology and data systems. More tools include Variable rate technology (VRT), Global positioning system and Geographical information system, Grid sampling, and remote sensors.[23]\nGeolocatinga field enables the farmer to overlay information gathered from analysis of soils and residual nitrogen, and information on previous crops and soil resistivity. Geolocation is done in two ways\nIntra and inter-field variability may result from a number of factors. These include climatic conditions (hail, drought, rain, etc.),soils(texture, depth, nitrogen levels), cropping practices (no-till farming),weedsand disease.\nPermanent indicators\u2014chiefly soil indicators\u2014provide farmers with information about the main environmental constants.\nPoint indicators allow them to track a crop's status, i.e., to see whether diseases are developing, if the crop is suffering fromwater stress, nitrogen stress, or lodging, whether it has been damaged by ice and so on.\nThis information may come from weather stations and other sensors (soil electrical resistivity, detection with the naked eye, satellite imagery, etc.).Soil resistivitymeasurements combined with soil analysis make it possible to measuremoisture content. Soil resistivity is also a relatively simple and cheap measurement.[24]\nUsingsoil maps, farmers can pursue two strategies to adjust field inputs:\nDecisions may be based on decision-supportmodels(crop simulation models andrecommendationmodels) based onbig data, but in the final analysis it is up to the farmer to decide in terms of business value and impacts on theenvironment- a role being takenover byartificial intelligence(AI) systems based onmachine learningandartificial neural networks.\nIt is important to realize why PA technology is or is not adopted, \"for PA technology adoption to occur the farmer has to perceive the technology as useful and easy to use. It might be insufficient to have positive outside data on the economic benefits of PA technology as perceptions of farmers have to reflect these economic considerations.\"[28]\nNew information and communication technologies make field level crop management more operational and easier to achieve for farmers.\nApplication of crop management decisions calls for agricultural equipment that supports variable-rate technology (VRT), for example varyingseeddensity along with variable-rate application (VRA) ofnitrogenand phytosanitary products.[29]\nPrecision agriculture uses technology on agricultural equipment (e.g. tractors, sprayers, harvesters, etc.):\nThe concept of precision agriculture first emerged in the United States in the early 1980s. In 1985, researchers at the University of Minnesota varied lime inputs in crop fields. It was also at this time that the practice of grid sampling appeared (applying a fixed grid of one sample per hectare). Towards the end of the 1980s, this technique was used to derive the first input recommendation maps for fertilizers and pH corrections. The use of yield sensors developed from new technologies, combined with the advent of GPS receivers, has been gaining ground ever since. Today, such systems cover several million hectares.\nIn the American Midwest (US), it is associated not with sustainable agriculture but with mainstream farmers who are trying to maximize profits by spending money only in areas that require fertilizer. This practice allows the farmer to vary the rate of fertilizer across the field according to the need identified by GPS guided Grid or Zone Sampling. Fertilizer that would have been spread in areas that don't need it can be placed in areas that do, thereby optimizing its use.\nAround the world, precision agriculture developed at a varying pace. Precursor nations were the United States, Canada and Australia. In Europe, the United Kingdom was the first to go down this path, followed closely by France, where it first appeared in 1997\u20131998. InLatin Americathe leading country isArgentina, where it was introduced in the middle 1990s with the support of theNational Agricultural Technology Institute.Brazilestablished a state-owned enterprise,Embrapa, to research and develop sustainable agriculture. The development of GPS and variable-rate spreading techniques helped to anchor precision farming[30]management practices. Today, less than 10% of France's farmers are equipped with variable-rate systems. Uptake of GPS is more widespread, but this hasn't stopped them using precision agriculture services, which supplies field-level recommendation maps.[31]\nWhile digital technologies can transform the landscape of agricultural machinery, making mechanization both more precise and more accessible, non-mechanized production is still dominant in many low- and middle-income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.[4][5]Research on precision agriculture for non-mechanized production is increasing and so is its adoption.[32][33][34]Examples include the AgroCares hand-held soil scanner, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) services (also known as drones), and GNSS to map field boundaries and establish land tenure.[35]However, it is not clear how many agricultural producers actually use digital technologies.[35][36]\nPrecision livestock farming supports farmers in real-time by continuously monitoring and controlling animal productivity, environmental impacts, and health and welfare parameters.[37]Sensors attached to animals or to barn equipment operate climate control and monitor animals\u2019 health status, movement and needs. For example, cows can be tagged with the electronic identification (EID) that allows a milking robot to access a database of udder coordinates for specific cows.[38]Global automatic milking system sales have increased over recent years,[39]but adoption is likely mostly in Northern Europe,[40]and likely almost absent in low- and middle-income countries.[41]Automated feeding machines for both cows and poultry also exist, but data and evidence regarding their adoption trends and drivers is likewise scarce.[4][5]\nThe economic and environmental benefits of precision agriculture have also been confirmed in China, but China is lagging behind countries such as Europe and the United States because the Chinese agricultural system is characterized by small-scale family-run farms, which makes the adoption rate of precision agriculture lower than other countries. Therefore, China is trying to better introduce precision agriculture technology into its own country and reduce some risks, paving the way for China's technology to develop precision agriculture in the future.[42]\nIn December 2014, the Russian President made an address to the Russian Parliament where he called for a National Technology Initiative (NTI). It is divided into subcomponents such as the FoodNet initiative. The FoodNet initiative contains a set of declared priorities, such as precision agriculture. This field is of special interest to Russia as an important tool in developing elements of the bioeconomy in Russia.[43][44]\nPrecision agriculture, as the name implies, means application of precise and correct amount of inputs like water, fertilizer, pesticides etc. at the correct time to the crop for increasing its productivity and maximizing its yields. Precision agriculture management practices can significantly reduce the amount of nutrient and other crop inputs used while boosting yields.[45]Farmers thus obtain a return on their investment by saving on water, pesticide, and fertilizer costs.\nThe second, larger-scale benefit of targeting inputs concerns environmental impacts.  Applying the right amount of chemicals in the right place and at the right time benefits crops, soils and groundwater, and thus the entire crop cycle.[46]Consequently, precision agriculture has become a cornerstone ofsustainable agriculture, since it respects crops, soils and farmers.  Sustainable agriculture seeks to assure a continued supply of food within the ecological, economic and social limits required to sustain production in the long term.\nA 2013 article tried to show that precision agriculture can help farmers in developing countries like India.[47]\nPrecision agriculture reduces the pressure of agriculture on the environment by increasing the efficiency of machinery and putting it into use. For example, the use of remote management devices such as GPS reduces fuel consumption for agriculture, while variable rate application of nutrients or pesticides can potentially reduce the use of these inputs, thereby saving costs and reducing harmful runoff into the waterways.[48]\nGPS also reduces the amount of compaction to the ground by following previously made guidance lines. This will also allow for less time in the field and reduce the environmental impact of the equipment and chemicals.\nPrecision agriculture produces large quantities of varied sensing data which creates an opportunity to adapt and reuse such data for archaeology and heritage work, enhancing  understanding ofarchaeologyin contemporary agricultural landscapes.[49]\nPrecision agriculture is an application of breakthrough digital farming technologies. Over $4.6 billion has been invested in agriculture tech companies\u2014sometimes called agtech.[18]\nSelf-steering tractorshave existed for some time now, asJohn Deereequipment works like a plane onautopilot. The tractor does most of the work, with the farmer stepping in for emergencies.[46]Technology is advancing towards driverless machinery programmed by GPS to spread fertilizer or plow land. Autonomy of technology is driven by the demanding need of diagnoses, often difficult to accomplish solely by hands-on farmer-operated machinery. In many instances of high rates of production, manual adjustments cannot sustain.[50]Other innovations include, partly solar powered, machines/robots that identify weeds and precisely kill them with a dose of a herbicide orlasers.[46][51][52]\nAgricultural robots, also known as AgBots, already exist, but advanced harvesting robots are being developed to identify ripe fruits, adjust to their shape and size, and carefully pluck them from branches.[53]\nDroneandsatellitetechnology are used in precision farming. This often occurs when drones take high quality images while satellites capture the bigger picture. Aerial photography from light aircraft can be combined with data from satellite records to predict future yields based on the current level of fieldbiomass. Aggregated images can create contour maps to track where water flows, determine variable-rate seeding, and create yield maps of areas that were more or less productive.[46]\nTheInternet of thingsis the network of physical objects outfitted with electronics that enable data collection and aggregation. IoT comes into play with the development of sensors[54]and farm-management software. For example, farmers can spectroscopically measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium inliquid manure, which is notoriously inconsistent.[46]They can then scan the ground to see where cows have already urinated and apply fertilizer to only the spots that need it. This cuts fertilizer use by up to 30%.[53]Moisture sensors[55]in the soil determine the best times to remotely water plants. Theirrigationsystems can be programmed to switch which side of tree trunk they water based on the plant's need and rainfall.[46]\nInnovations are not just limited to plants\u2014they can be used for the welfare of animals.Cattlecan be outfitted with internal sensors to keep track of stomach acidity and digestive problems. External sensors track movement patterns to determine the cow's health and fitness, sense physical injuries, and identify the optimal times for breeding.[46]All this data from sensors can be aggregated and analyzed to detect trends and patterns.\nAs another example, monitoring technology can be used to make beekeeping more efficient. Honeybees are of significant economic value and provide a vital service to agriculture by pollinating a variety of crops. Monitoring of a honeybee colony's health via wireless temperature, humidity and CO2sensors helps to improve the productivity of bees, and to read early warnings in the data that might threaten the very survival of an entire hive.[56]\nSmartphone and tablet applications are becoming increasingly popular in precision agriculture. Smartphones come with many useful applications already installed, including the camera, microphone, GPS, and accelerometer. There are also applications made dedicated to various agriculture applications such as field mapping, tracking animals, obtaining weather and crop information, and more. They are easily portable, affordable, and have high computing power.[57]\nMachine learning is commonly used in conjunction with drones, robots, and internet of things devices. It allows for the input of data from each of these sources. The computer then processes this information and sends the appropriate actions back to these devices. This allows for robots to deliver the perfect amount of fertilizer or for IoT devices to provide the perfect quantity of water directly to the soil.[58]Machine learning may also provide predictions to farmers at the point of need, such as the contents of plant-availablenitrogen in soil, to guide fertilization planning.[59]As more agriculture becomes ever more digital, machine learning will underpin efficient and precise farming with less manual labour.\nThis article incorporates text from afree contentwork.

Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.[1]It has been a part of the official program of theSummer Olympic GamessinceTokyo 1964.Beach volleyballwas introduced to the program at theAtlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted version of volleyball at theSummer Paralympic Gamesissitting volleyball.\nThecomplete set of rulesis extensive,[2]but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court.[3]The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the court, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.[3]Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack. An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus, losing the point. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally. A few of the most common faults include:\nThe ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short contact) the ball with any part of the body.[4]\nA number of consistenttechniqueshave evolved in volleyball, includingspikingandblocking(because those plays are made above the top of the net, thevertical jumpis an athletic skill emphasized in the sport) as well aspassing,setting, and specialized player positions. Offensive and defensive structures are also key plays.[5]\nWilliam G. Morganinvented the sport in 1895 while he was theYMCAphysical education director  inHolyoke, Massachusetts.[6]Because he originally derived the game from badminton, he initially named the sportmintonette.[7]He was a one-time student ofbasketballinventorJames Naismithand invented the game for his clients at the YMCA, most of whom were middle-aged businessmen for whom the physical demands of basketball were too great.[8]\nThe first rules, written down by Morgan, called for a net 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m) high, a 25\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a050\u00a0ft (7.6\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a015.2\u00a0m) court, and any number of players. A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents' court. In case of a serving error, a second try was allowed. Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul (with loss of the point or a side-out)\u2014except in the case of the first-try serve.[9]\nAfter an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School (now calledSpringfield College), the game quickly became known asvolleyball(it was originally spelled as two words: \"volley ball\"). Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game spread around the country to various YMCAs.[9][10]\nIn the early 1900sSpalding, through its publishing company American Sports Publishing Company, produced books with complete instruction and rules for the sport.[11]\nThe first official ball used in volleyball is disputed; some sources say Spalding created the first official ball in 1896, while others claim it was created in 1900.[12][13][14]The rules evolved over time: in 1916, in the Philippines, the skill and power of the set and spike had been introduced, and four years later a \"three hits\" rule and a rule against hitting from the back row were established. In 1917, the game was changed from requiring 21 points to win to a smaller 15 points to win. In 1919, about 16,000 volleyballs were distributed by theAmerican Expeditionary Forcesto their troops andallies, which sparked the growth of volleyball in new countries.[12]\nLike basketball, volleyball spread quickly due to its simplicity and promotion by the YMCA andYWCA.[8]The first country outside the United States to adopt volleyball was Canada in 1900.[12]During and afterWorld War I, the presence of YMCA instructors in American forces led to the spread of volleyball in Europe, where clubs were established inFranceas well as severalSovietnations.[8]An international federation, theF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball(FIVB), was founded in 1947, and the first World Championships were held in 1949 for men and 1952 for women.[15]The sport is now popular inBrazil, in Europe, where especiallyItaly, theNetherlands, andEastern Europehave been major forces since the late 1980s, inRussia, in other countries, includingChinaand the rest ofAsia, and in theUnited States.[10][9][15]\nBeach volleyball, a variation of the game played on sand and with only two players per team, became a FIVB-endorsed variation in 1987 and was added to the Olympic program at the1996 Summer Olympics.[12][15]Volleyball is also a sport at theParalympicsmanaged byWorld ParaVolley.[16]\nNudistswere early adopters of the game with regular organized play in clubs as early as the late 1920s.[17][18]By the 1960s, a volleyball court had become standard in almost allnudist/naturistclubs.[19]Recently a debate has arisen within the sport regarding the inclusion oftransgenderplayers. With transgender athletes includingTiffany Abreujoining professional volleyball teams alongside other non-transgender teammates, many professionals, sports analysts, and fans of volleyball either express concerns about the legitimacy and fairness of having transgender players on a team or convey support for the transgender players.[20]\nVolleyball has been part of theSummer Olympicsprogram for both men and women consistently since1964.\nA volleyball court is 9\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a018\u00a0m (29.5\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a059.1\u00a0ft), divided into equal square halves by a net with a width of one meter (39.4\u00a0in).[21]The top of the net is2.43\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft11+11\u204416in) above the center of the court for men's competition, and2.24\u00a0m (7\u00a0ft4+3\u204416in) for women's competition, varied for veterans and junior competitions.[3]\nThe minimum height clearance for indoor volleyball courts is 7\u00a0m (23.0\u00a0ft), although a clearance of 8\u00a0m (26.2\u00a0ft) is recommended.[21]\nA line 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) from and parallel to the net is considered the \"attack line\". This \"3 meter\" (or \"10-foot\") line divides the court into \"back row\" and \"front row\" areas and the back court and front court.[21]These are in turn divided into 3 areas each: these are numbered as follows, starting from area \"1\", which is the position of the serving player:\nAfter a team gains the serve (also known as siding out), its members must rotate in a clockwise direction, with the player previously in area \"2\" moving to area \"1\" and so on, with the player from area \"1\" moving to area \"6\".[3]Each player rotates only one time after the team gains possession of the service; the next time each player rotates will be after the other team wins possession of the ball and loses the point.[21]\nThe team courts are surrounded by an area called the free zone which is a minimum of 3 meters wide and which the players may enter and play within after the service of the ball.[22]All lines denoting the boundaries of the team court and the attack zone are drawn or painted within the dimensions of the area and are therefore a part of the court or zone. If a ball comes in contact with the line, the ball is considered to be \"in\". An antenna is placed on each side of the net perpendicular to the sideline and is a vertical extension of the side boundary of the court. A ball passing over the net must pass completely between the antennae (or their theoretical extensions to the ceiling) without contacting them.[3]\nFIVBregulations state that the ball must be spherical, made of leather or synthetic leather, have a circumference of 65\u201367\u00a0cm (26\u201326\u00a0in), a weight of 260\u2013280\u00a0g (9.2\u20139.9\u00a0oz) and an interior air pressure of 0.30\u20130.325\u00a0kg/cm2(4.26 to 4.61 psi; 294.3\nto 318.82 mbar or hPa).[23]Other governing bodies have similar regulations.\nEach team consists of six players.[21]To get play started, a team is chosen to serve bycoin toss. A player from the serving team throws the ball into the air and attempts to hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team's court (theserve).[21]The opposing team must use a combination of no more than three contacts with the volleyball to return the ball to the opponent's side of the net.[21]These contacts usually consist first of thebumporpassso that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards the player designated as thesetter; second of theset(usually an over-hand pass using wrists to push finger-tips at the ball) by the setter so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards a spot where one of the players designated as anattackercan hit it, and third by theattackerwhospikes(jumping, raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent's court) to return the ball over the net.[3]The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be onoffence.\nThe team ondefenceattempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court: players at the net jump and reach above the top (and if possible, across the plane) of the net toblockthe attacked ball.[3]If the ball is hit around, above, or through the block, the defensive players arranged in the rest of the court attempt to control the ball with adig(usually a fore-arm pass of a hard-driven ball). After a successful dig, the team transitions to offence.\nThe game continues in this manner, rallying back and forth until the ball touches the court within the boundaries or until an error is made.[21]The most frequent errors that are made are either to fail to return the ball over the net within the allowed three touches, or to cause the ball to land outside the court.[21]A ball is \"in\" if any part of it touches the inside of a team's court or a sideline or end-line, and a strong spike may compress the ball enough when it lands that a ball which at first appears to be going out may instead be in. Players may travel well outside the court to play a ball that has gone over a sideline or end-line in the air. A standard competitive volleyball match is played in a best-of-five sets format and typically goes on for about 90 minutes.[24]\nOther common errors include a player touching the ball twice in succession, a player catching the ball, a player touching the net while attempting to play the ball, or a player penetrating under the net into the opponent's court. There are a large number of other errors specified in the rules, although most of them are infrequent occurrences. These errors include back-row or libero players spiking the ball or blocking (back-row players may spike the ball if they jump from behind the attack line), players not being in the correct position when the ball is served, attacking the serve in the front court and above the height of the net, using another player as a source of support to reach the ball, stepping over the back boundary line when serving, taking more than 8 seconds to serve,[25]or playing the ball when it is above the opponent's court.\nA point is scored when the ball contacts the floor within the court boundaries or when an error is made: when the ball strikes one team's side of the court, the other team gains a point; and when an error is made, the team that did not make the error is awarded a point, in either case paying no regard to whether they served the ball or not. If any part of the ball hits the line, the ball is counted as in the court. The team that won the point serves for the next point. If the team which won the point served in the previous point, the same player serves again. If the team that won the point did not serve the previous point, the players of the team acquiring the serve rotate their position on the court in a clockwise manner. The game continues, with the first team to score 25 points by a two-point margin awarded the set. Matches are best-of-five sets and the fifth set, if necessary, is usually played to 15 points. (Scoring differs between leagues, tournaments, and levels; high schools sometimes play best-of-three to 25; in theNCAAmatches are played best-of-five to 25 as of the2008season.)[26]\nBefore 1999, points could be scored only when a team had the serve (side-out scoring) and all sets went up to only 15 points. The FIVB changed the rules in 1999 (with the changes being compulsory in 2000) to use the current scoring system (formerly known asrally point system), primarily to make the length of the match more predictable and to make the game more spectator- and television-friendly. The final year of side-out scoring at theNCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Championshipwas2000. Rally point scoring debuted in2001,[27]and games were played to 30 points through2007. For the2008season, games were renamed \"sets\" and reduced to 25 points to win. Most high schools in the U.S. changed to rally scoring in 2003,[28][29][30]and several states implemented it the previous year on an experimental basis.[31]\nThe libero player was introduced internationally in 1998,[32]and made its debut for NCAA competition in 2002.[33]The libero is a player specialized in defensive skills: the libero must wear a contrasting jersey color from their teammates and cannot block or attack the ball when it is entirely above net height. When the ball is not in play, the libero can replace any back-row player, without prior notice to the officials. This replacement does not count against the substitution limit each team is allowed per set, although the libero may be replaced only by the player whom he or she replaced. Most U.S. high schools added the libero position from 2003 to 2005.[29][34]\nThe modern-day libero often takes on the role of a second setter. When the setter digs the ball, the libero is typically responsible for the second ball and sets to the front row attacker. The libero may function as a setter only under certain restrictions. To make an overhand set, the libero must be standing behind (and not stepping on) the 3-meter line; otherwise, the ball cannot be attacked above the net in front of the 3-meter line. An underhand pass is allowed from any part of the court. The libero is, generally, the most skilled defensive player on the team. There is also a libero tracking sheet, where the referees or officiating team must keep track of whom the libero subs in and out for.\nUnder FIVB rules, a libero is not allowed to serve. By contrast, a libero can serve in NCAA volleyball, but only in a specific rotation. That is, the libero can only serve for one person, not for all of the people for whom he or she goes in. That rule change was implemented in 2004 and applied to high school and junior high play soon after.\nUnder FIVB rules, each team can designate two liberos at the beginning of play, only one of whom can be on the court at any time, and each libero can serve in one specific rotation. This rule was implemented in NCAA women's volleyball, effective with the fall 2024 season.[35]\nOther rule changes enacted in 2000 include allowing serves in which the ball touches the net, as long as it goes over the net into the opponents' court. Also, the service area was expanded to allow players to serve from anywhere behind the end line but still within the theoretical extension of the sidelines. Other changes were made to lighten up calls on faults for carries and double-touches, such as allowing multiple contacts by a single player (\"double-hits\") on a team's first contact provided that they are a part of a single play on the ball.[36]\nIn 2008, the NCAA changed the minimum number of points needed to win any of the first four sets from 30 to 25 for women's volleyball (men's volleyball remained at 30 for another three years, switching to 25 in 2011). If a fifth (deciding) set is reached, the minimum required score remains at 15. In addition, the word \"game\" is now referred to as \"set\".[26]\nTheOfficial Volleyball Rulesare prepared and updated every few years by the FIVB's Rules of the Game and Refereeing Commission.[37]The latest edition is usually available on the FIVB's website.[2]\nCompetitive teams master six basic skills: serve, pass, set, attack, block and dig.[3]Each of the skills consitsts of a number of specific techniques which have been introduced over the years and are now considered standard practice in high-level volleyball.\nA player stands behind the inline and serves the ball in an attempt to drive it into the opponent's court. The main objective is to make it land inside the court; it is also desirable to set the ball's direction, speed and acceleration so that it becomes difficult for the receiver to handle it properly.[3]A serve is called an \"ace\" when the ball either lands directly onto the opponent's court or the first opponent to touch the ball is unable to volley it (hit it upwards enough for a teammate to continue).\nIn contemporary volleyball, many types of serves are employed:\nAlso called reception, the pass is the attempt by a team to properly handle the opponent's serve or any form of attack. Proper handling includes not only preventing the ball from touching the court but also making it reach the position where the setter is standing quickly and precisely.[3]\nThe skill of passing involves fundamentally two specific techniques: underarm pass, or bump, where the ball touches the inside part of the joined forearms or platform, at waistline; and overhand pass, where it is handled with the fingertips, like a set, above the head.[3]Either are acceptable in professional andbeach volleyball; however, there are much tighter regulations on the overhand pass in beach volleyball. When a player passes a ball to their setter, it is ideal that the ball does not have a lot of spin to make it easier for the setter.\nThe set is usually the second contact that a team makes with the ball.[3]The main goal of setting is to put the ball in the air in such a way that it can be driven by an attack into the opponent's court.[3]The setter coordinates the offensive movements of a team, and is the player who ultimately decides which player will attack the ball.\nAs with passing, one may distinguish between an overhand and a bump set. Since the former allows for more control over the speed and direction of the ball, the bump is used only when the ball is so low it cannot be properly handled with fingertips, or in beach volleyball where rules regulating overhand setting are more stringent. In the case of a set, one also speaks of a front or back set, meaning whether the ball is passed in the direction the setter is facing or behind the setter. There is also a jump set that is used when the ball is too close to the net. In this case, the setter usually jumps off their right foot straight up to avoid going into the net. The setter usually stands about \u2154 of the way from the left to the right of the net and faces the left (the larger portion of net that the setter can see).\nSometimes a setter refrains from raising the ball for a teammate to perform an attack and tries to play it directly onto the opponent's court. This movement is called a \"dump\".[40]This can only be performed when the setter is in the front row, otherwise it constitutes an illegal back court attack. The most common dumps are to 'throw' the ball behind the setter or in front of the setter to zones 2 and 4. More experienced setters toss the ball into the deep corners or spike the ball on the second hit.\nAs with a set or an overhand pass, the setter/passer must be careful to touch the ball with both hands at the same time.[3]If one hand is noticeably late to touch the ball this could result in a less effective set, as well as the referee calling a 'double hit' and giving the point to the opposing team.\nThe attack, also known as thespike, is usually the third contact a team makes with the ball.[3]The object of attacking is to handle the ball so that it lands on the opponent's court and cannot be defended.[3]A player makes a series of steps (the \"approach\"), jumps, and swings at the ball.\nIdeally, the contact with the ball is made at the apex of the hitter's jump. At the moment of contact, the hitter's arm is fully extended above their head and slightly forward, making the highest possible contact while maintaining the ability to deliver a powerful hit. The hitter uses arm swing, wrist snap, and a rapid forward contraction of the entire body to drive the ball.[3]A 'bounce' is a slang term for a very hard/loud spike that follows an almost straight trajectory steeply downward into the opponent's court and bounces very high into the air. A \"kill\" is the slang term for an attack that is not returned by the other team thus resulting in a point.\nContemporary volleyball comprises a number of attacking techniques:[41]\nBlocking refers to the actions taken by players standing at the net to stop or alter an opponent's attack.[3]A block which is aimed at completely stopping an attack, thus making the ball remain in the opponent's court, is called an offensive block. A well-executed offensive block is performed by jumping and reaching to penetrate with one's arms and hands over the net and into the opponent's area.[3]It requires anticipating the direction the ball will go once the attack takes place.[3]It may also require calculating the best footwork to executing the \"perfect\" block.\nThe jump should be timed so as to intercept the ball's trajectory prior to it crossing over the plane of the net. Palms are held deflected downward roughly 45\u201360 degrees toward the interior of the opponents' court. A \"roof\" is a spectacular offensive block that redirects the power and speed of the attack straight down to the attacker's floor as if the attacker hit the ball into the underside of a peaked house roof. By contrast, it is called a defensive, or \"soft\" block if the goal is to control and deflect the hard-driven ball up so that it slows down and becomes easier to defend. A well-executed soft-block is performed by jumping and placing one's hands above the net with no penetration into the opponent's court and with the palms up and fingers pointing backwards.\nBlocking is also classified according to the number of players involved. Thus, there are single (or solo), double, and triple blocks.[3]\nSuccessful blocking does not always result in a \"roof\" and many times does not even touch the ball. While it is obvious that a block was a success when the attacker is roofed, a block that consistently forces the attacker away from their 'power' or preferred attack into a more easily controlled shot by the defence is also a highly successful block. At the same time, the block position influences the positions where other defenders place themselves while opponent hitters are spiking.\nDigging is the ability to prevent the ball from touching one's court after a spike or attack, particularly a ball that is nearly touching the ground.[3]In many aspects, this skill is similar to passing, or bumping: overhand dig and bump are also used to distinguish between defensive actions taken with fingertips or with joined arms.[3]It varies from passing, however, in that it is a much more reflex-based skill, especially at the higher levels. It is especially important while digging for players to stay on their toes; several players choose to employ a split step to make sure they are ready to move in any direction.\nSome specific techniques are more common in digging than in passing. A player may sometimes perform a \"dive\", i.e., throw their body in the air with a forward movement in an attempt to save the ball, and land on their chest. When the player also slides their hand under a ball which is almost touching the court it is called a \"pancake\". The pancake is frequently used in indoor volleyball, but rarely if ever in beach volleyball because the uneven and yielding nature of the sand court limits the chances that the ball will make good, clean contact with the hand. When used correctly, it is one of the more spectacular defensive volleyball plays.\nSometimes a player may also be forced to drop their body quickly to the floor to save the ball. In this situation, the player makes use of a specific rolling technique to minimize the chances of injuries.\nVolleyball is essentially a game of transition from one of the above skills to the next, with choreographed team movement between plays on the ball. The team's movements are determined by the teams chosen serve receive system, offensive system, coverage system, and defensive system.\nThe serve-receive system is the formation used by the receiving team to attempt to pass the ball to the designated setter. Systems can consist of 5 receivers, 4 receivers, 3 receivers, and in some cases 2 receivers. The most popular formation at higher levels is a 3 receiver formation consisting of two left sides and a libero receiving every rotation. This allows middles and right sides to become more specialized at hitting and blocking. Offensive systems are the formations used by the offence to attempt to ground the ball into the opposing court (or otherwise score points). Formations often include designated player positions with skill specialization (seePlayer specialization, below). Popular formations include the 4\u20132, 6\u20132, and 5-1 systems (seeFormations, below). There are also several different attacking schemes teams can use to keep the opposing defence off balance.\nCoverage systems are the formations used by the offence to protect their court in the case of a blocked attack. Executed by the 5 offensive players not directly attacking the ball, players move to assigned positions around the attacker to dig up any ball that deflects off the block back into their own court. Popular formations include the 2-3 system and the 1-2-2 system. In lieu of a system, some teams just use a random coverage with the players nearest the hitter.\nDefensive systems are the formations used by the defence to protect against the ball being grounded into their court by the opposing team. The system will outline which players are responsible for which areas of the court depending on where the opposing team is attacking from. Popular systems include the 6-Up, 6-Back-Deep, and 6-Back-Slide defence. There are also several different blocking schemes teams can employ to disrupt the opposing teams' offence. When one player is ready to serve, some teams will line up their other five players in a screen to obscure the view of the receiving team. This action is only illegal if the server makes use of the screen, so the call is made at the referee's discretion as to the impact the screen made on the receiving team's ability to pass the ball. The most common style of screening involves a W formation designed to take up as much horizontal space as possible.\nThere are five positions filled on every volleyball team at the elite level:  setter, outside hitter (left-side hitter), middle hitter (middle blocker), opposite hitter (right-side hitter) and libero / defensive specialist. Each of the positions plays a specific, key role in winning a volleyball match.\nAt some levels where substitutions are unlimited, teams will make use of adefensive specialistin place of or in addition to a libero. This position does not have unique rules like the libero position, instead, these players are used to substitute out a poor back row defender using regular substitution rules. A defensive specialist is often used if you have a particularly poor back court defender in right side or left side, but your team is already using a libero to take out your middles. Most often, the situation involves a team using a right-side player with a big block who must be subbed out in the back row because they are not able to effectively play backcourt defence. Similarly, teams might use a serving specialist to sub out a poor server.\nThe three standard volleyball formations are known as \"4\u20132\", \"6\u20132\" and \"5\u20131\", which refers to the number of hitters and setters respectively. 4\u20132 is a basic formation used only in beginners' play, while 5\u20131 is by far the most common formation in high-level play.\nThe 4\u20132 formation has four hitters and two setters. The setters usually set from the middle front or right front position. The team will, therefore, have two front-row attackers at all times. In the international 4\u20132, the setters set from the right front position. The international 4\u20132 translates more easily into other forms of offence. The setters line up opposite each other in the rotation. The typical lineup has two outside hitters. By aligning like positions opposite themselves in the rotation, there will always be one of each position in the front and back rows. After service, the players in the front row move into their assigned positions, so that the setter is always in the middle front. Alternatively, the setter moves into the right front and has both a middle and an outside attacker; the disadvantage here lies in the lack of an offside hitter, allowing one of the other team's blockers to \"cheat in\" on a middle block.\nThe clear disadvantage with this offensive formation is that there are only two attackers, leaving a team with fewer offensive weapons.\nAnother aspect is to see the setter as an attacking force, albeit a weakened force, because when the setter is in the frontcourt they are able to 'tip' or 'dump', so when the ball is close to the net on the second touch, the setter may opt to hit the ball over with one hand. This means that the blocker who would otherwise not have to block the setter is engaged and may allow one of the hitters to have an easier attack.\nIn the 6\u20132 formation, a player always comes forward from the back row to set. The three front row players are all in attacking positions. As a result all six players act as hitters at one time or another, while two can act as setters. So the 6\u20132 formation is now a 4\u20132 system, but the back-row setter penetrates to set. The 6\u20132 lineup thus requires two setters, who line up opposite to each other in the rotation. In addition to the setters, a typical lineup will have two middle hitters and two outside hitters. By aligning like positions opposite themselves in the rotation, there will always be one of each position in the front and back rows. After service, the players in the front row move into their assigned positions.\nThe advantage of the 6\u20132 is that there are always three front-row hitters available, maximizing the offensive possibilities. However, not only does the 6\u20132 require a team to possess two people capable of performing the highly specialized role of setter, it also requires both of those players to be effective offensive hitters when not in the setter position. At the international level, only theCubanNational Women's Team employs this kind of formation. It is also used byNCAAteams inDivision IIImen's play and women's play in all divisions, partially due to the variant rules used which allow more substitutions per set than the 6 allowed in the standard rules\u201412 in matches involving two Division III men's teams[44]and 15 for all women's play.[45]\nThe 5\u20131 formation has only one player who assumes setting responsibilities regardless of their position in the rotation. The team will, therefore, have three front-row attackers when the setter is in the back row and only two when the setter is in the front row, for a total of five possible attackers.\nThe player opposite the setter in a 5\u20131 rotation is called theopposite hitter. In general, opposite hitters do not pass; they stand behind their teammates when the opponent is serving. The opposite hitter may be used as a third attack option (back-row attack) when the setter is in the front row: this is the normal option used to increase the attack capabilities of modern volleyball teams. Normally the opposite hitter is the most technically skilled hitter of the team. Back-row attacks generally come from the back-right position, known as zone 1, but are increasingly performed from back-centre in high-level play.\nThe big advantage of the system is that the setter always has 3 hitters with which to vary sets. If the setter performs well, the opponent's middle blocker may not have enough time to block with the outside blocker, increasing the chance for the attacking team to make a point.\nThere is another advantage, the same as that of a 4\u20132 formation: as a front-row player the setter is allowed to jump and \"dump\" the ball onto the opponent's side. Thus the setter can confuse the opponent's blocking players; they have the option to jump and dump or set to one of the hitters. A good setter knows and they are able to jump to dump or to set for a quick hit as well as when setting outside, thus they are able to confuse the opponent.\nThe 5\u20131 offence is a mix of 6\u20132 and 4\u20132: when the setter is in the front row, the offense looks like a 4\u20132; when the setter is in the back row, the offense looks like a 6\u20132.\nThere are many variations on the basic rules of volleyball. By far the most popular of these isbeach volleyball, which is played on sand with two people per team and rivals the main sport in popularity.\nSome games related to volleyball include:", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3Schools": "Contents\nW3Schools\nFunctions\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nW3Schoolsis afreemiumeducational website for learningcodingonline.[1][2]Initially released in 1998, it derives its name from theWorld Wide Webbut is not affiliated with theW3 Consortium.[3][4][unreliable source]W3Schools offers courses covering many aspects of web development.[5]W3Schools also publishes free HTML templates.

Unqualified,the wordfootballgenerally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly calledfootballincludeassociation football(known assoccerin Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand);Australian rules football;Gaelic football;gridiron football(specificallyAmerican football,arena football, orCanadian football);International rules football;rugby league football; andrugby union football.[1]These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as \"football codes\".\nThere are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.[2][3][4]Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification ofthese games at English public schoolsduring the 19th century, itself an outgrowth ofmedieval football.[5][6]The expansion and cultural power of theBritish Empireallowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled empire.[7]By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing:Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8]In 1888, theFootball Leaguewas founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popularteam sportsin the world.[9]\nThe various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football:carryingcodes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, andkickingcodes such as association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.[10]\nCommon rules among the sports include:[11]\nIn all codes, common skills includepassing,tackling, evasion of tackles, catching andkicking.[10]In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of playersoffside, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over acrossbarbetween thegoalposts.\nThere are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word \"football\".  It is widely assumed that the word \"football\" (or the phrase \"foot ball\") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.[13]There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games inmedieval Europethat were playedon foot.[14]There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.\nThe Chinese competitive gamecujuis an early type of ball game where feet were used, in some aspects resembling modernassociation football. It was possibly played around theHan dynastyand earlyQin dynasty, based on an attestation in a military manual from around the second to third centuries BC.[15][16][17]In one version, gameplay consisted of players passing the ball between teammates without allowing it to touch the ground (much likekeepie uppie). In its competitive version, two teams had to pass the ball without it falling, before kicking the ball through a circular hole placed in the middle of the pitch. Unlike association football, the two teams did not interact with each other but instead stayed on opposite sides of the pitch.[18]Cuju has been cited by FIFA as the earliest form of football.[4]The Japanese version ofcujuiskemari(\u8e74\u97a0), and was developed during theAsuka period.[19]This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court inKyotofrom about 600\u00a0AD. Inkemari, several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground.\nTheSilk Roadfacilitated the transmission ofcuju, especially the game popular in theTang dynasty, the period when theinflatableball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball.[20]\nTheAncient GreeksandRomansare known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman gameharpastumis believed to have been adapted from aGreekteam game known as\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2(episkyros)[21][22]or\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03bd\u03b4\u03b1(phaininda),[23]which is mentioned by a Greek playwright,Antiphanes(388\u2013311\u00a0BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologianClement of Alexandria(c.150\u2013c.215 AD). These games appear to have resembledrugby football.[24][25][26][27][28]The Roman politicianCicero(106\u201343\u00a0BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, thefollis.[29][30]Episkyrosis described as an early form of football by FIFA.[31]\nThere are a number of references to traditional,ancient, orprehistoricball games, played byindigenous peoplesin many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer namedJohn Daviswent ashore to play a form of football withInuitin Greenland.[32]There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, calledAqsaqtuk. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In 1610,William Strachey, a colonist atJamestown, Virginiarecorded a game played by Native Americans, calledPahsaheman.[citation needed]Pasuckuakohowog, a game similar to modern-dayassociation footballplayed amongstAmerindians, was also reported as early as the 17th century.\nGames played in Mesoamericawith rubber balls byindigenous peoplesare also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities tobasketballorvolleyball, and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially theIroquoisConfederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game,lacrosse(as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of \"football\".[citation needed]\nOn theAustralian continentseveral tribes ofindigenous peopleplayed kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians asMarn Grook(Djab Wurrungfor \"game ball\"). The earliest historical account is ananecdotefrom the 1878 book byRobert Brough-Smyth,The Aborigines of Victoria, in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 inVictoria, Australia, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: \"Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of apossumand how other players leap into the air in order to catch it.\" Some historians have theorised thatMarn Grookwas one of theorigins ofAustralian rules football.\nTheM\u0101oriin New Zealand played a game calledK\u012b-o-rahiconsisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.[citation needed]\nThese games and others may well go far back into antiquity. However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially England.\nMahmud al-Kashgariin hisD\u012bw\u0101n Lugh\u0101t al-Turk, described a game calledtepukamongTurksinCentral Asia. In the game, people try to attack each other's castle by kicking a ball made of sheep leather.[33]\nTheMiddle Agessaw a huge rise in popularity of annualShrovetide footballmatches throughout Europe, particularly in England. An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th-centuryHistoria Brittonum, attributed toNennius, which describes \"a party of boys ... playing at ball\".[34]References to a ball game played in northern France known asLa SouleorChoule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks,[35]date from the 12th century.[36]\nThe early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as \"mob football\", would be played in towns or between neighbouring villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clashen masse,[37]struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal'sbladder[38]to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes.[39]The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter,[38]and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below).\nThe first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given byWilliam FitzStephenin about 1174\u20131183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival ofShrove Tuesday:\nAfter lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.[40]\nMost of the very early references to the game speak simply of \"ball play\" or \"playing at ball\". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.\nAn early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 atUlgham, Northumberland, England:  \"Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David\".[41]Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a \"football game\" atNewcastle, County Downbeing charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard.[42]Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 atShouldham, Norfolk, England: \"[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself\".[41]\nIn 1314,Nicholas de Farndone,Lord Mayor of the City of Londonissued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: \"[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee][43]in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.\" This is the earliest reference to football.\nIn 1363, KingEdward III of Englandissued a proclamation banning \"...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games\",[44]showing that \"football\" \u2013 whatever its exact form in this case \u2013 was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball.\nA game known as \"football\" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906. There is evidence for schoolboys playing a \"football\" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word \"pass\" in the most recent translation is derived from \"huc percute\" (strike it here) and later \"repercute pilam\" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as \"goal\" is \"metum\", literally meaning the \"pillar at each end of the circus course\" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to \"get hold of the ball before [another player] does\" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation \"Throw yourself against him\" (Age, objice te illi).\nKingHenry IV of Englandalso presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word \"football\", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for \"foteball\".[41][45]\nThere is also an account inLatinfrom the end of the 15th century of football being played atCaunton, Nottinghamshire. This is the first description of a \"kicking game\" and the first description ofdribbling: \"[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions.\" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: \"[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.[41]\nOther firsts in the medieval andearly moderneras:\nIn the 16th century, the city ofFlorencecelebrated the period betweenEpiphanyandLentby playing a game which today is known as \"calcio storico\" (\"historic kickball\") in thePiazza Santa Croce.[49]The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football. For example,calcioplayers could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wroteDiscorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).\nThere have been many attempts to ban football, from theMiddle Agesthrough to the modern day. The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667.[50]:\u200a6Women werebanned from playingat English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s. Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.\nAmerican footballalso faced pressures to ban the sport.  The game played in the 19th century resembledmob footballthat developed in medieval Europe, including a version popular on university campuses known asold division football, and several municipalities banned its play in the mid-19th century.[51][52]By the 20th century, the game had evolved to a more rugby style game.  In 1905, there were calls to banAmerican footballin the U.S. due to its violence; a meeting that year was hosted by American presidentTheodore Rooseveltled to sweeping rules changes that caused the sport to diverge significantly from its rugby roots to become more like the sport as it is played today.[53]\nWhile football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, itspublic schools(equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its \"mob\" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students, and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between \"kicking\" and \"running\" (or \"carrying\") games first became clear.\nThe earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools \u2013 mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes \u2013 comes from theVulgariaby William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster atEtonandWinchestercolleges and hisLatintextbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase \"We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde\".[54]\nRichard Mulcaster, a student at Eton College in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as \"the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football\".[55]Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (\"sides\" and \"parties\"), positions (\"standings\"), a referee (\"judge over the parties\") and a coach \"(trayning maister)\". Mulcaster's \"footeball\" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:\n[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.[56]\nIn 1633,David Wedderburn, a teacher fromAberdeen, mentioned elements of modern football games in a short Latin textbook calledVocabula.Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as \"keeping goal\" and makes an allusion to passing the ball (\"strike it here\"). There is a reference to \"get hold of the ball\", suggesting that some handling was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players (\"drive that man back\").[57]\nA more detailed description of football is given inFrancis Willughby'sBook of Games, written in about 1660.[58]Willughby, who had studied atBishop Vesey's Grammar School,Sutton Coldfield, is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: \"a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals.\" His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field. He also mentions tactics (\"leaving some of their best players to guard the goal\"); scoring (\"they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win\") and the way teams were selected (\"the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness\"). He is the first to describe a \"law\" of football: \"they must not strike [an opponent's leg] higher than the ball\".[59][60]\nEnglish public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the firstoffsiderules, during the late 18th century.[61]In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were \"off their side\" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in ascrumor similarformation. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester,Rugby,HarrowandCheltenham, during between 1810 and 1850.[61]The first known codes \u2013 in the sense of a set of rules \u2013 were those of Eton in 1815[62]andAldenhamin 1825.[62])\nDuring the early 19th century, most working-class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, manychildren were part of the labour force.Feast dayfootball played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.\nFootball was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby,Marlboroughand Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow,WestminsterandCharterhouse). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the schoolcloisters, making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.[citation needed]\nWilliam Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have \"with a fine disregard for the rules of football,as played in his time[emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game.\" in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern association football, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,[63]the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard wasrunning forward with itas the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards.\nThe boom in rail transport in Britainduring the 1840s meant that people were able to travel farther and with less inconvenience than they ever had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two-halves, one half played by the rules of the host \"home\" school, and the other half by the visiting \"away\" school.\nThemodernrules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's firstlawnmowerin 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.[64]\nApart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see\u00a7\u00a0British schools).\nPublic schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after theFactory Act 1850, which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children. Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From 1850, they could not work before 6\u00a0a.m. (7\u00a0a.m. in winter) or after 6\u00a0p.m. on weekdays (7\u00a0p.m. in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2\u00a0pm. These changes meant that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football.\nThe earliest known matches between public schools are as follows:\nSports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for exampleLondon's Gymnastic Societywhich was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.[68][66]\nThe first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called \"The Foot-Ball Club\" who were located inEdinburgh, Scotland, during the period 1824\u201341.[69][70]The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.[70]\nIn 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football.[71]This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game.\nThe earliest known matches involving non-public school clubs or institutions are as follows:\nOne of the longest running football fixture is theCordner-Eggleston Cup, contested betweenMelbourne Grammar SchoolandScotch College, Melbourneevery year since 1858. It is believed by many to also be the first match ofAustralian rules football, although it was played under experimental rules in its first year. The first football trophy tournament was the Caledonian Challenge Cup, donated by the RoyalCaledonianSociety of Melbourne, played in 1861 under theMelbourne Rules.[83]The oldest football league is a rugby football competition, theUnited Hospitals Challenge Cup(1874), while the oldest rugby trophy is theYorkshire Cup, contested since 1878. TheSouth Australian Football Association(30 April 1877) is the oldest surviving Australian rules football competition. The oldest surviving soccer trophy is theYoudan Cup(1867) and the oldest national football competition is the English FA Cup (1871).The Football League(1888) is recognised as the longest running association football league.The first international Rugby football matchtook place between Scotland and England on 27 March 1871 atRaeburn Place,Edinburgh. Thefirst international Association football matchofficially took place between sides representing England and Scotland on 30 November 1872 atHamilton Crescent, theWest of Scotland Cricket Club's ground inPartick,Glasgowunder the authority of the FA.\nIn Europe, early footballs were made out of animalbladders, more specificallypig's bladders, which were inflated. Later leather coverings were introduced to allow the balls to keep their shape.[84]However, in 1851,Richard LindonandWilliam Gilbert, both shoemakers from the town ofRugby(near the school), exhibited both round and oval-shaped balls at theGreat Exhibitionin London. Richard Lindon's wife is said to have died of lung disease caused by blowing up pig's bladders.[a]Lindon also won medals for the invention of the \"Rubber inflatable Bladder\" and the \"Brass Hand Pump\".\nIn 1855, the U.S. inventorCharles Goodyear\u2013 who had patentedvulcanised rubber\u2013 exhibited a spherical football, with an exterior of vulcanised rubber panels, at theParisExhibition Universelle. The ball was to prove popular in early forms of football in the U.S.[85]\nThe iconic ball with a regular pattern of hexagons and pentagons (seetruncated icosahedron) did not become popular until the 1960s, and was first used in the World Cupin 1970.\nThe earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn, a poet and teacher inAberdeen, Scotland.[86]Nevertheless, the original text does not state whether the allusion to passing as 'kick the ball back' ('repercute pilam') was in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams (as was usual at this time).[87]\n\"Scientific\" football is first recorded in 1839 fromLancashire[88]and in the modern game in rugby football from 1862[89]and from Sheffield FC as early as 1865.[90][91]The first side to play a passingcombination gamewas theRoyal Engineers AFCin 1869/70.[92][93]By 1869 they were \"work[ing] well together\", \"backing up\" and benefiting from \"cooperation\".[94]By 1870 the Engineers were passing the ball: \"Lieut. Creswell, who having brought the ball up the side then kicked it into the middle to another of his side, who kicked it through the posts the minute before time was called\".[95]Passing was a regular feature of their style.[96]By early 1872 the Engineers were the first football team renowned for \"play[ing] beautifully together\".[97]A double pass is first reported from Derby school againstNottingham Forestin March 1872, the first of which is irrefutably ashortpass: \"Mr Absey dribbling the ball half the length of the field delivered it to Wallis, who kicking it cleverly in front of the goal, sent it to the captain who drove it at once between the Nottingham posts\".[98]The first side to have perfected the modern formation wasCambridge University AFC;[99][100][101]they also introduced the 2\u20133\u20135 \"pyramid\" formation.[102][103]\nRugby football was thought to have been started about 1845 atRugby SchoolinRugby, Warwickshire, England although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date tomedievaltimes. InBritain, by 1870, there were 49 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game.[104]There were also \"rugby\" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form theRugby Football Union(RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871.[105]These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included thetry, where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest. Regardless of any form of football, the first international match between the national team ofEnglandandScotlandtook place at Raeburn Place on 27 March 1871.\nRugby footballsplit intoRugby union,Rugby league,American football, andCanadian football.Tom Willsplayed Rugby football in England before foundingAustralian rules football.\nDuring the nineteenth century, several codifications of the rules of football were made at theUniversity of Cambridge, in order to enable students from different public schools to play each other. The Cambridge Rules of 1863 influenced the decision of theFootball Associationto ban Rugby-style carrying of the ball in its own first set of laws.[106]\nBy the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football.Sheffield Football Club, founded in 1857 in the English city ofSheffieldby Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football.[107]However, the club initially played its own code of football: theSheffield rules. The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of anoffsiderule.\nThe code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These includedfree kicks,corner kicks, handball,throw-insand the crossbar.[108]By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England. At this time, a series of rule changes by both theLondonandSheffieldFAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877.\nThere is archival evidence of \"foot-ball\" games being played in various parts of Australia throughout the first half of the 19th century. The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 inMelbourne, the capital city ofVictoria.\nIn July 1858,Tom Wills, an Australian-borncricketereducated atRugby Schoolin England, wrote a letter toBell's Life in Victoria& Sporting Chronicle, calling for a \"foot-ball club\" with a \"code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during winter.[109]This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football. Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to co-ordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules,[110]the first of which was played on 31 July 1858. One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match betweenMelbourne Grammar SchoolandScotch College. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity.\nWills and others involved in these early matches formed theMelbourne Football Club(the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills,William Hammersley,J. B. ThompsonandThomas H. Smithmet with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for variousrugby footballrules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions.H. C. A. Harrison, a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted \"a game of our own\".[111]The code was distinctive in the prevalence of themark,free kick,tackling, lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised forthrowing the ball.\nThe Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated theGeelong Football Club's rules, making the game then known as \"Victorian Rules\" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adoptedcricket fieldsand an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featuredbouncing the ball while runningandspectacular high marking. The game spread quickly to otherAustralian colonies. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and inother parts of the world, and theAustralian Football Leagueemerged as the dominant professional competition.\nDuring the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master atUppingham School, and he issued his own rules of what he called \"The Simplest Game\" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863, another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.\nAt theFreemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in theLondon Metropolitan areamet for the inaugural meeting of theFootball Association(FA). The aim of the association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball andhacking(kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:\nIX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.[112]\nAt the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, butF. M. Campbell, the representative fromBlackheathand the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: \"hacking is the true football\". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the \"Laws of the Game\", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as association football. The term \"soccer\", in use since the late 19th century, derives from anOxford University abbreviationof \"association\".[113]\nThe first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim amark, which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to afree kickat goal, from 15 yards (13.5 metres) in front of the goal line.\nAs was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students. For example, students atDartmouth CollegeinNew Hampshireplayed a game calledOld division football, a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s.[52]They remained largely \"mob football\" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common.[51]The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them.Yale University, under pressure from the city ofNew Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, whileHarvard Universityfollowed suit in 1861.[51]In its place, two general types of football evolved: \"kicking\" games and \"running\" (or \"carrying\") games. A hybrid of the two, known as the \"Boston game\", was played by a group known as theOneida Football Club. The club, considered by some historians as the first formalfootball clubin the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the Boston game onBoston Common.[51][114]The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s. The universities of Yale,Princeton(then known as the College of New Jersey),Rutgers, andBrownall began playing \"kicking\" games during this time. In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the EnglishFootball Association.[51]\nIn Canada, the first documented football match was a practice game played on 9 November 1861, atUniversity College, University of Toronto(approximately 400 yards west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school.[116]In 1864, atTrinity College, Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A. Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based onrugby football.[116]A \"running game\", resembling rugby football, was then taken up by theMontreal Football Clubin Canada in 1868.[117]\nOn 6 November 1869,RutgersfacedPrincetonin a game that was played with a round ball and, like all early games, used improvised rules. It is usually regarded asthe first game of American intercollegiate football.[51][118]\nModern North American football grew out ofa matchbetweenMcGill Universityof Montreal andHarvard Universityin 1874. During the game, the two teams alternated between the rugby-based rules used by McGill and the Boston Game rules used by Harvard.[119][120][121]Within a few years, Harvard had both adopted McGill's rules and persuaded other U.S. university teams to do the same. On 23 November 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, andColumbiamet at the Massasoit Convention inSpringfield, Massachusetts, agreeing to adopt most of theRugby Football Unionrules, with some variations.[122]\nIn 1880,YalecoachWalter Camp, who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations. Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby were replacing thescrummagewith theline of scrimmageand the establishment of thedown-and-distancerules.[122]American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.[123]This led U.S. PresidentTheodore Rooseveltto hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on 9 October 1905, urging them to make drastic changes.[124]One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legalforward pass. Though it was underutilised for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.[125]\nOver the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. In 1903, theOntario Rugby Football Unionadopted theBurnside rules, which implemented theline of scrimmageanddown-and-distancesystem from American football, among others.[126]Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929.[127]American and Canadian footballremain different codes, stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not.\nIn the mid-19th century, various traditional football games, referred to collectively ascaid, remained popular in Ireland, especially inCounty Kerry. One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms ofcaidduring this period: the \"field game\" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic \"cross-country game\" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. \"Wrestling\", \"holding\" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.\nBy the 1870s, rugby and association football had started to become popular in Ireland.Trinity College Dublinwas an early stronghold of rugby (see theDevelopments in the 1850ssection above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms ofcaidhad begun to give way to a \"rough-and-tumble game\" which allowed tripping.\nThere was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of theGaelic Athletic Association(GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such ashurlingand to reject imported games like rugby and association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up byMaurice Davinand published in theUnited Irelandmagazine on 7 February 1887.[128]Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).\nTheInternational Rugby Football Board(IRFB) was founded in 1886,[129]but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code.Professionalismhad already begun to creep into the various codes of football.\nIn England, by the 1890s, a long-standingRugby Football Unionban onprofessionalplayers was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met inHuddersfieldto form theNorthern Rugby Football Union(NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.\nThe demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better \"spectator\" sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of theline-out. This was followed by the replacement of theruckwith the \"play-the-ball ruck\", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled.Maulswere stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby League, the first time the namerugby leaguewas used officially in England.\nOver time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known asrugby union.\nThe need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. TheF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association(FIFA) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904.[130]Its first president wasRobert Gu\u00e9rin.[130]The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.\nRugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professionalrugby leagues were launched in Australiathe following year. However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, theRugby League International Federation(RLIF) was formed at a meeting inBordeaux.\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept ofdowns: a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately).  The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as thesix tackle rule.\nWith the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five-metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10\u00a0metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.\nThe laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league. In particular, goals frommarkswere abolished, kicks directlyinto touchfrom outside the22-metreline were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusiveruckormaul, and the lifting of players inline-outswas legalised.\nIn 1995, rugby union became an \"open\" game, that is one which allowed professional players.[131]Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared \u2013 and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification \u2013 the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.\nThe wordfootball, when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much controversy has occurred over the termfootball, primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of theEnglish-speaking world. Most often, the wordfootballis used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region (which is association football in most countries). So, effectively, what the wordfootballmeans usually depends on where one says it.\nIn each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely asfootball, while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand,footballhistorically referred torugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the wordfootballin Australia is eitherAustralian rules footballorrugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to theBarassi Line). InfrancophoneQuebec, whereCanadian footballis more popular, the Canadian code is known asle footballwhile American football is known asle football am\u00e9ricainand association football is known asle soccer.[132]\nOf the 45 nationalFIFA(F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association) affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, most currently useFootballin their organisations' official names; the FIFA affiliates inCanadaand theUnited StatesuseSoccerin their names. A few FIFA affiliates have recently \"normalised\" to usingFootball, including:\nSeveral of the football codes are the most popular team sports in the world.[9]Globally,association footballis played by over 250 million players in over 200 nations,[137]and has the highest television audience in sport,[138]making it the most popular in the world.[139]American football, with 1.1\u00a0millionhigh school footballplayers and nearly 70,000college footballplayers, is the most popularsport in the United States,[140][141]with the annualSuper Bowlgame accounting for nine of the top ten of themost watched broadcasts in U.S. television history.[142]TheNFLhas the highest averageattendance(67,591) of any professional sports league in the world and has the highestrevenue[143]out of any single professional sports league.[144]Thus, the best association football and American football players are among thehighest paid athletes in the world.[145][146][147]\nAustralian rules footballhas the highest spectator attendance of all sports in Australia.[148][149]Similarly,Gaelic footballis the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance,[150]and theAll-Ireland Football Finalis the most watched event of that nation's sporting year.[151]\nRugby unionis the most popular sport in New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji.[152]It is also the fastest growing sport in the U.S.,[153][154][155][156]withcollege rugbybeing the fastest growing[clarification needed][157][158]college sportin that country.[159][dubious\u2013discuss]\n20.75\u201321.25 inches (52.7\u201354.0\u00a0cm) (transversal)\n20\u201321 inches (51\u201353\u00a0cm) (transversal)\n20.75\u201321.375 inches (52.71\u201354.29\u00a0cm) (transversal)\n58 - 62 centimetres (circular)\n54.5 -55.5 centimetres (circular)\n6.25\u20136.75 inches (15.9\u201317.1\u00a0cm) (transversal)\n6.25\u20136.75 inches (15.9\u201317.1\u00a0cm) (transversal)\nThese codes have in common the prohibition of the use of hands (by all players except the goalkeeper, though outfield players can \"throw-in\" the ball when it goes out of play), unlike other codes where carrying or handling the ball by all players is allowed\nThe hockey gamebandyhas rules partly based on the association football rules and is sometimes nicknamed as 'winter football'.\nThere are also motorsport variations of the game.\nThese codes have in common the ability of players to carry the ball with their hands, and to throw it to teammates, unlike association football where the use of hands during play is prohibited by anyone except the goalkeeper.

They also provide enjoyment to participants and, in some cases,entertainmentto spectators.[2]Many sports exist, with different participant numbers, some are done by a single person with others being done by hundreds. Most sports take place either inteamsor competing as individuals. Some sports allow a \"tie\" or \"draw\", in which there is no single winner; others providetie-breaking methodsto ensure one winner. A number of contests may be arranged in atournamentformat, producing achampion. Manysports leaguesmake an annual champion by arranging games in a regularsports season, followed in some cases byplayoffs.\nSport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physicalathleticismor physicaldexterity, with major competitions admitting only sports meeting this definition.[3]Some organisations, such as theCouncil of Europe, preclude activities without any physical element from classification as sports.[2]However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition asmind sports. TheInternational Olympic Committeewho oversee theOlympic Gamesrecognises bothchessandbridgeas sports.SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: chess, bridge,draughts,Goandxiangqi.[4][5]However, they limit the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.[1]Sport is usually governed by a set ofrulesorcustoms, which serve to ensure fair competition. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoringgoalsor crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.\nRecords of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported insport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, withspectator sportdrawing large crowds tosport venues, and reaching wider audiences throughbroadcasting.Sport bettingis in some cases severely regulated, and in others integral to the sport.\nAccording toA.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013.[6]The world's most accessible and practised sport isrunning, whileassociation footballis the most popular spectator sport.[7]\nThe word \"sport\" comes from theOld Frenchdesportmeaning \"leisure\", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being \"anything humans find amusing or entertaining\".[8]\nOther meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise.[9]Roget's defines the noun sport as an \"activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement\" with synonyms including diversion and recreation.[10]\nThe singular term \"sport\" is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e.g. \"children taking part in sport\"), with \"sports\" used to describe multiple activities (e.g. \"football and rugby are the most popular sports in England\"). American English uses \"sports\" for both terms.[citation needed]\nThe precise definition of what differentiates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources. The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by theGlobal Association of International Sports Federations(GAISF), which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (includingassociation football,athletics,cycling,tennis,equestrian sports, and more), and is therefore thede factorepresentative of international sport.\nGAISF uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:[1]\nThey also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such asrugbyorathletics), primarily mind (such aschessorGo), predominantly motorised (such asFormula 1orpowerboating), primarily co-ordination (such assnookerand othercue sports), or primarily animal-supported (such asequestrian sport).[1]\nThe inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports.[11]Whilst GAISF recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sports.\nThere has been an increase in the application of the term \"sport\" to a wider set of non-physical challenges such asvideo games, also calledesports(from \"electronic sports\"), especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations. According toCouncil of Europe, European Sports Charter, article 2.i,\"'Sport' means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels.\"[12]\nThere are opposing views on the necessity ofcompetitionas a defining element of a sport, with almost allprofessional sportsinvolving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or GAISF.[1]\nOther bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity. For instance, theCouncil of Europeinclude all forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun.[citation needed]\nIn order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as schoolsports days, although moves like this are often controversial.[13][14]\nIn competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their \"result\" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.g. gender, weight and age). The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with \"handicaps\" or penalties. In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurement. Ingymnasticsordivingthe result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective. There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.[citation needed]\nArtifacts and structures suggestsport in Chinaas early as 2000 BC.[15]Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China's ancient past. Monuments to thePharaohsindicate that a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago inancient Egypt.[16]Other Egyptian sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling.Ancient Persiansports such as the traditional Iranian martial art ofZoorkhanehhad a close connection to warfare skills.[17]Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia arepoloandjousting. Varioustraditional games of Indiasuch asKho khoandKabbadihave been played for thousands of years. The kabaddi was played potentially as a preparation for hunting.[18]\nA wide range of sports were already established by the time ofAncient Greeceand the military culture and the development of sport in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sport became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created theOlympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in thePeloponnesuscalledOlympia.[19]\nSports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century. Industrialisation has brought motorised transportation and increasedleisure time, letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities. These trends continued with the advent ofmass mediaand global communication. Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes\u00a0\u2013 all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports. Since the turn of the 21st\u00a0century, there has been increasing debate about whethertransgendersports people should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their post-transitiongender identity.[20]\nSportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat.[21][22][23]\nSportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. The well-known sentiment by sports journalistGrantland Rice, that it is \"not that you won or lost but how you played the game\", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founderPierre de Coubertin: \"The most important thing... is not winning but taking part\" are typical expressions of this sentiment.[citation needed]\nKey principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win. Rules are in place to ensure fair play, but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage.\nParticipants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of winning, or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial gains. The widespread existence ofgamblingon the results of sports events creates a motivation formatch fixing, where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than simply playing to win.\nThe competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such asincreasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means.\nAll sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances.[citation needed]\nViolence in sportsinvolves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence. Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration.Riotingorhooliganismby fans in particular is a problem at some national and international sporting contests.[citation needed]\nFemale participation in sports continues to rise alongside the opportunity for involvement and the value of sports forchild developmentandphysical fitness. Despite increases in female participation during the last three decades, a gap persists in the enrollment figures between male and female players in sports-related teams. Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US interscholastic athletics.[citation needed]\nCertain sports aremixed-gender, allowing (or even requiring) men and women to play on the same team. One example of this isBaseball5, which is the first mixed-gender sport to have been admitted into an Olympic event.[24]\nYouth sport presents children with opportunities for fun, socialisation, forming peer relationships,physical fitness, andathletic scholarships. Activists foreducationand thewar on drugsencourage youth sport as a means to increaseeducational participationand to fight theillegal drug trade. According to theCenter for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital, the biggest risk for youth sport is death or serious injury includingconcussion. These risks come from running, basketball, association football, volleyball, gridiron, gymnastics, and ice hockey.[25]Youth sport in the US is a $15 billion industry including equipment up to private coaching.[26]\nDisabled or adaptive sports are played by people with adisability, includingphysicalandintellectual disabilities. As many of these are based on existing sports modified to meet the needs of people with a disability, they are sometimes referred to asadapted sports. However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for people with a disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports.[citation needed]\nMasters sport,senior sport, orveteran sportis an age category of sport, that usually contains age groups of those 35 and older.[27]It may concern unaltered or adapted sport activities, with and without competitions.\nCompetitions\nThe competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played. This has led to the specific phenomenon of spectator sport.\nBoth amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person at the sport venue, and through broadcast media includingradio,televisionandinternetbroadcast. Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an entrance ticket, orpay-per-viewtelevision broadcast.Sports leagueandtournamentare two common arrangements to organise sport teams or individual athletes into competing against each other continuously or periodically.[citation needed]\nIt is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain events. The footballWorld Cupattracts a global television audience of hundreds of millions; the2006finalalone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700\u00a0million and the2011 Cricket World Cup Finalattracted an estimated audience of 135\u00a0million in India alone.[28]\nIn the United States, the championship game of theNFL, theSuper Bowl, has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year.[29][30]Super Bowl Sunday is ade factonational holiday in America;[31][32]the viewership being so great that in 2015, advertising space was reported as being sold at$4.5m for a 30-second slot.[29]\nSport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of awageorsalary). Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called \"grassroots sport\".[2][33]\nThe popularity ofspectator sportas a recreation for non-participants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this has incentivised a high payingprofessional sportculture, where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages, which can run into millions of dollars.[34]\nSome sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy of allowing onlyamateur sport. TheOlympic Gamesstarted with a principle of amateur competition with those who practised a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.[35]From 1971, Olympic athletes were allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship,[36]and from 1986, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics,[36][37]with the exceptions ofboxing,[38][39]and wrestling.[40][41]\nTechnology plays an important part in modern sport. It is a necessary part of some sports (such as motorsport), and it is used in others to improve performance. Some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making.\nSports scienceis a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied to areas including athlete performance, such as the use of video analysis to fine-tune technique, or to equipment, such as improvedrunning shoesorcompetitive swimwear.Sports engineeringemerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport, from analytics and big data towearable technology.[42]In order to control the impact of technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants. For example, in 2010, full-body, non-textile swimsuits were banned byFINA, as they were enhancing swimmers' performances.[43][44]\nThe increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken, or reviewed, off-field, with another official using instant replays to make decisions. In some sports, players can now challenge decisions made by officials. InAssociation football,goal-line technologymakes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the goal line or not.[45]The technology is not compulsory,[46]but was used in the2014 FIFA World Cupin Brazil,[47]and the2015 FIFA Women's World Cupin Canada,[48]as well as in thePremier Leaguefrom2013\u201314,[49]and theBundesligafrom2015\u201316.[50]In theNFL, a referee can ask for a review from the replay booth, or a head coach can issue achallengeto review the play using replays. The final decision rests with the referee.[51]A video referee (commonly known as aTelevision Match Officialor TMO) can also use replays to help decision-making in rugby (bothleagueandunion).[52][53]In international cricket, an umpire can ask theThird umpirefor a decision, and the third umpire makes the final decision.[54][55]Since 2008, adecision review systemfor players to review decisions has been introduced and used inICC-run tournaments, and optionally in other matches.[54][56]Depending on the host broadcaster, a number of different technologies are used during an umpire or player review, including instant replays,Hawk-Eye,Hot SpotandReal Time Snickometer.[57][58]Hawk-Eye is also used in tennis to challenge umpiring decisions.[59][60]\nResearch suggests that sports have the capacity to connectyouthto positive adult role models and provide positive development opportunities, as well as promote the learning and application of lifeskills.[61][62]In recent years the use of sport to reducecrime, as well as to preventviolent extremismandradicalization, has become more widespread, especially as a tool to improveself-esteem, enhance social bonds and provide participants with a feeling of purpose.[62]\nThere is no high-quality evidence that shows the effectiveness of interventions to increase sports participation of the community in sports such as mass media campaigns, educational sessions, and policy changes.[63]There is also no high-quality studies that investigate the effect of such interventions in promoting healthy behaviour change in the community.[64]\nBenito Mussoliniused the1934 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Italy, to showcaseFascist Italy.[65][66]Adolf Hitleralso used the1936 Summer Olympicsheld inBerlin, and the1936 Winter Olympicsheld inGarmisch-Partenkirchen, to promote theNazi ideologyof the superiority of theAryan race, and inferiority of the Jews and other \"undesirables\".[66][67]Germany used the Olympics to give off a peaceful image while secretly preparing for war.[68]\nWhenapartheidwas the official policy in South Africa, many sports people, particularly inrugby union, adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects.[69]\nIn the history of Ireland, Gaelic sports were connected withcultural nationalism. Until the mid-20th\u00a0century a person could have been banned from playingGaelic football,hurling, or other sports administered by theGaelic Athletic Association(GAA) if she/he played or supportedAssociation football, or other games seen to be ofBritishorigin. Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football andrugby unionat Gaelic venues. This ban, also known as Rule 42,[70]is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played inCroke ParkwhileLansdowne Roadwas redeveloped intoAviva Stadium. Until recently, under Rule 21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of theRUCfrom playing Gaelic games, but the advent of theGood Friday Agreementin 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.[71]\nNationalismis often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view. On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in theFootball War. These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants. Sport and politics collided in the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli Olympic team and killed many of their men. This was known as theMunich massacre.[citation needed]\nA study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results. A study published in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciencesshowed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5\u00a0per cent. A loss had the opposite effect, and the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and losses.[72]Also, whenWashington Redskinswin their final game before an election, then the incumbent president is more likely to win, and if the Redskins lose, then the opposition candidate is more likely to win; this has become known as theRedskins Rule.[73][74]\n\u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie, in his essayDiscourse on Voluntary Servitudedescribes athletic spectacles as means for tyrants to control their subjects by distracting them.\nDo not imagine that there is any bird more easily caught by decoy, nor any fish sooner fixed on the hook by wormy bait, than are all these poor fools neatly tricked into servitude by the slightest feather passed, so to speak, before their mouths. Truly it is a marvellous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at the slightest tickling of their fancy. Plays, farces, spectacles, gladiators, strange beasts, medals, pictures, and other such opiates, these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery, the price of their liberty, the instruments of tyranny. By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke, that the stupefied peoples, fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes, learned subservience as na\u00efvely, but not so creditably, as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books.[75]\nDuring the British rule ofBengal, British and European sports began to supplanttraditional Bengali sports, resulting in a loss of native culture.[76][77]\nSport was an important form of worship inAncient Greek religion. Theancient Olympic Gameswere held in honour of the head deity,Zeus, and featured various forms of religious dedication to him and other gods.[78]\nThe practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form ofidolatry, in which \"human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves.\"[79]Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of \"collective pride\" and \"national self-deification\" in which feats of human power are idolised at the expense of divine worship.[79]\nTertulliancondemns the athletic performances of his day, insisting \"the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry.\"[80]The shows, says Tertullian, excite passions foreign to the calm temperament cultivated by the Christian:\nGod has enjoined us to deal calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone in keeping with the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness. ... Well, how shall this be made to accord with the shows? For the show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is pleasure, there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and where there is keenness of feeling, there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to that. Then, too, where you have rivalry, you have rage, bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from them\u00a0\u2013 the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of Christ.[81]\nChristian clerics in theWesleyan-Holiness movementoppose the viewing of or participation in professional sports, believing that professional sports leaguesprofane the Sabbath, compete with a Christian's primary commitment to God, exhibit a lack of modesty in the players' and cheerleaders' uniforms, are associated with violence and extensive use of profanity among many players, and encourage gambling, as well as alcohol and other drugs at sporting events, which go against a commitment toteetotalism.[82]\nRelated topics\nThis article incorporates text from afree contentwork.

Sports are part of everyculturepast and present, but each culture has its own definition of sports. The most useful definitions are those that clarify the relationship of sports toplay, games, and contests. \u201cPlay,\u201d wrote the German theorist Carl Diem, \u201cis purposeless activity, for its own sake, the opposite of work.\u201d Humans work because they have to; they play because they want to. Play is autotelic\u2014that is, it has its own goals. It is voluntary and uncoerced.Recalcitrantchildren compelled by their parents or teachers to compete in a game offootball(soccer) are not really engaged in a sport. Neither are professional athletes if their only motivation is their paycheck. In the real world, as a practical matter, motives are frequently mixed and often quite impossible to determine. Unambiguous definition is nonetheless a prerequisite to practical determinations about what is and is not an example of play.\nThere are at least two types of play. The first is spontaneous and unconstrained. Examples abound. A child sees a flat stone, picks it up, and sends it skipping across the waters of a pond. An adult realizes with a laugh that he has uttered an unintended pun. Neither action is premeditated, and both are at least relatively free of constraint. The second type of play is regulated. There are rules to determine which actions arelegitimateand which are not. These rules transform spontaneous play into games, which can thus be defined as rule-bound or regulated play. Leapfrog,chess, \u201cplaying house,\u201d andbasketballare all games, some with rather simple rules, others governed by a somewhat more complex set of regulations. In fact, the rule books for games such as basketball are hundreds of pages long.\nAs games, chess and basketball are obviously different from leapfrog and playing house. The first two games are competitive, the second two are not. One can win a game of basketball, but it makes no sense to ask who has won a game of leapfrog. In other words, chess and basketball are contests.\nA final distinction separates contests into two types: those that require at least a minimum of physical skill and those that do not.Shuffleboardis a good example of the first; the board gamesScrabbleandMonopolywill do to exemplify the second. It must of course be understood that even the simplest sports, such asweightlifting, require amodicumofintellectualeffort, while others, such asbaseball, involve a considerable amount of mental alertness. It must also be understood that the sports that have most excited the passions of humankind, as participants and as spectators, have required a great deal more physical prowess than a game of shuffleboard. Through the ages, sports heroes have demonstrated awesome strength, speed, stamina, endurance, anddexterity.\nClick Here to see full-size tableSports, then, can be defined as autotelic (played for their own sake) physical contests. On the basis of this definition, one can devise a simple inverted-tree diagram. Despite the clarity of the definition, difficult questions arise. Ismountain climbinga sport? It is if one understands the activity as a contest between the climber and the mountain or as a competition between climbers to be the first to accomplish an ascent. Are the drivers at theIndianapolis 500automobile race really athletes? They are if one believes that at least a modicum of physical skill is required for winning the competition. The point of a clear definition is that it enables one to give more or less satisfactory answers to questions such as these. One can hardly understand sport if one does not begin with someconceptionof what sports are.\nNo one can say when sports began. Since it is impossible to imagine a time when children did not spontaneously run races or wrestle, it is clear that children have always included sports in their play, but one can only speculate about the emergence of sports as autotelic physical contests for adults.Huntersare depicted in prehistoric art, but it cannot be known whether the hunters pursued their prey in a mood of grim necessity or with the joyful abandon of sportsmen. It is certain, however, from the rich literary and iconographic evidence of all ancient civilizations thathuntingsoon became an end in itself\u2014at least for royalty and nobility. Archaeological evidence also indicates thatballgames were common among ancient peoples as different as the Chinese and the Aztecs. If ball games were contests rather than noncompetitiveritualperformances, such as theJapanesefootball gamekemari, then they were sports in the most rigorously defined sense. That it cannot simply be assumed that they were contests is clear from the evidence presented by Greek and Roman antiquity, which indicates that ball games had been for the most part playful pastimes like those recommended for health by the Greek physician Galen in the 2nd centuryce.\nIt is unlikely that the 7th-century Islamic conquest ofNorth Africaradically altered the traditional sports of the region. As long as wars were fought withbow and arrow, archery contests continued to serve as demonstrations of ready prowess. The prophet Muhammad specifically authorized horse races, and geography dictated that men race camels as well as horses. Hunters, too, took their pleasures on horseback.\nAmong the many games of North Africa wasta kurt om el mahag(\u201cthe ball of the pilgrim\u2019s mother\u201d), a Berber bat-and-ball contest whose configuration bore an uncanny resemblance to baseball.Koura, more widely played, was similar to football (soccer).\nCultural variation among black Africans was far greater than among the Arab peoples of the northern littoral. Ball games were rare, butwrestlingof one kind or another wasubiquitous. Wrestling\u2019s forms and functions varied from tribe to tribe. For theNubaofsouthern Sudan, ritual bouts, for which men\u2019s bodies were elaborately decorated as well as carefully trained, were the primary source of male status andprestige. TheTutsiandHutuof Rwanda were among the peoples who staged contests between females. Among the various peoples ofsub-Saharan Africa, wrestling matches were a way to celebrate or symbolically encourage human fertility and the earth\u2019s fecundity. In southern Nigeria, for instance,Igbotribesmen participated in wrestling matches held every eighth day throughout the three months of the rainy season; hard-fought contests, it was thought, persuaded the gods to grant abundant harvests of corn (maize) and yams. Among the Diola of the Gambia,adolescentboys and girls wrestled (though not against one another) in what was clearly a prenuptial ceremony. Male champions were married to their female counterparts. In other tribes, such as theYalaof Nigeria, theFonof Benin, and the Njabi of the Congo, boys and girls grappled with each other. Among the Kole, it was the kin of the bride and the bridegroom who wrestled. Stick fights, which seem to have been less closely associated with religious practices, were common among many tribes, including theZuluandMpondoof southern Africa.\nContests for runners and jumpers were to be found across the length and breadth of the continent. During the age of imperialism, explorers and colonizers were often astonished by the prowess of these \u201cprimitive\u201d peoples.Nandirunners of Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley seemed to run distances effortlessly at a pace that brought European runners to pitiable physical collapse. Tutsi high jumpers of Rwanda and Burundi soared to heights that might have seemed incredible had not the jumpers been photographed in flight by members ofAdolf Friedrichzu Mecklenburg\u2019s anthropological expedition at the turn of the 20th century.\nLong before European conquest introduced modern sports andmarginalizednative customs, conversion to Islam tended to undercut\u2014if not totally eliminate\u2014the religious function of African sports, but elements of pre-Christian and pre-Islamic magical cults have survived into postcolonial times. Zulu football players rely not only on their coaches and trainers but also on the services of theirinyanga(\u201cwitch doctor\u201d).\nLike the highly evolved civilizations of which they are a part, traditional Asian sports are ancient and various. Competitions were never as simple as they seemed to be. From the IslamicMiddle Eastacross theIndian subcontinentto China and Japan, wrestlers\u2014mostly but not exclusively male\u2014embodied and enacted the values of theircultures. The wrestler\u2019s strength was always more than a merely personal statement. More often than not, the men who strained and struggled understood themselves to be involved in a religious endeavour. Prayers, incantations, and rituals of purification were for centuries an important aspect of the hand-to-hand combat of Islamic wrestlers. It was not unusual to combine the skills of the wrestler with those of a mystic poet. Indeed, the celebrated 14th-century Persianpahlavan(ritual wrestler) Ma\u1e25m\u016bd Khw\u0101rezm\u012b was both.\nTypical of the place of sport within a religiouscontextwas the spectacle of 50 sturdy Turks who wrestled in Istanbul in 1582 to celebrate the circumcision of the son ofMurad III. When Indian wrestlers join anakhara(gymnasium), they commit themselves to the quest for a holy life. As devout Hindus, they recitemantrasas they do their knee bends and push-ups. In their struggle against \u201cpollution,\u201d they strictly control their diet, sexual habits, breathing, and even their urination and defecation.\nWhile the religious aspects of Turkish and Iranian \u201chouses of strength\u201d (where weightlifting and gymnastics were practiced) became much lesssalientin the course of the 20th century, the elders in charge of Japanesesumoadded a number ofShint\u014delements to the rituals of their sport to underscore their claim that it is a unique expression of Japanese tradition. A somewhat arbitrary distinction can be made between wrestling and the many forms of unarmed hand-to-hand combat categorized as martial arts. The emphasis of the latter is military rather than religious, instrumental rather than expressive. Chinesewushu(\u201cmilitary skill\u201d), which included armed as well as unarmed combat, was highly developed by the 3rd centurybce. Its unarmed techniques were especially prized within Chinese culture and were an important influence on the martial arts of Korea, Japan, andSoutheast Asia. Much less well known in the West arevarma adi(\u201chitting thevitalspots\u201d) and other martial arts traditions ofSouth Asia. In the early modern era, as unarmed combat became obsolete, the emphasis of Asian martial arts tended to shift back toward religion. This shift can often be seen in the language of sports. Japanesekenjutsu(\u201ctechniques of the sword\u201d) becamekend\u014d(\u201cthe way of the sword\u201d).\nOf the armed (as opposed to unarmed) martial arts, archery was among the most important in the lives of Asian warriors from the Arabian to the Korean peninsulas. Notably, the Japanesesamuraipracticed many forms of archery, the most colourful of which was probablyyabusame, whosemountedcontestants drew their bows and loosed their arrows while galloping down a straight track some 720 to 885 feet (220 to 270 metres) long. They were required to shoot in quick succession at three small targets\u2014each about 9 square inches (55 square cm) placed on 3-foot- (0.9-metre-) high poles 23 to 36 feet (7 to 11 metres) from the track and spaced at intervals of 235 to 295 feet (71.5 to 90 metres). Inyabusame, accuracy was paramount.\nIn Turkey, where the composite (wood plus horn) bow was an instrument ofgreat power, archers competed for distance. At Istanbul\u2019s Okmeydan\u0131 (\u201cArrow Field\u201d), the record was set in 1798 whenSelim III\u2019s arrow flew more than 2,900 feet (884 metres).\nAs can be seen in Mughal art of the 16th and 17th centuries, aristocratic Indians\u2014like their counterparts throughout Asia\u2014used their bows and arrows for hunting as well as for archery contests. Mounted hunters demonstratedequestrianas well as toxophilite skills. The Asian aristocrat\u2019s passion for horses, which can be traced as far back as Hittite times, if not earlier, led not only to horse races (universal throughout Asia) but also to the development ofpoloand a host of similar equestrian contests. These equestrian games may in fact be the most distinctive Asian contribution to the repertory of modern sports.\nIn all probability, polo evolved from a far rougher game played by the nomads of Afghanistan andCentral Asia. In the form that survived into the 21st century, Afghanbuzkashiis characterized by a dustymeleein which hundreds of mounted tribesmen fought over the headlesscarcassof a goat. The winner was the hardy rider who managed to grab the animal by the leg and drag it clear of the pack. Sincebuzkashiwas clearly an inappropriate passion for a civilized monarch, polo filled the bill. Persian manuscripts from the 6th century refer to polo played during the reign of Hormuz I (271\u2013273). The game was painted by miniaturists and celebrated by Persian poets such asFerdows\u012b(c. 935\u2013c. 1020) and\u1e24\u0101fe\u1e93(1325/26\u20131389/90). By 627 polo had spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and had reached China, where it became a passion among those wealthy enough to own horses. (All 16 emperors of theTang dynasty[618\u2013907] were polo players.) As with most sports, the vast majority of polo players were male, but the 12th-century Persian poetNe\u1e93\u0101m\u012bcommemoratedthe skills of Princess Sh\u012br\u012bn. Moreover, if numerous terra-cotta figures can be trusted as evidence, polo was also played by aristocratic Chinese women.\nThere were also ball games for ordinary men and women. Played with carefully sewn stuffed skins, with animal bladders, or with found objects as simple as gourds, chunks of wood, or rounded stones, ball games are universal. Ball games of all sorts were quite popular among the Chinese. Descriptions of the gamecuju, which resembled modern football (soccer), appeared as early as the EasternHan dynasty(25\u2013220). Games similar to modernbadmintonwere also played in the 1st century. Finally, theMing dynasty(1368\u20131644)scroll paintingGrove of Violetsdepicts elegantly attired ladies playingchuiwan, a game similar to moderngolf.\nSports were unquestionably common inancient Egypt, where pharaohs used their huntingprowessand exhibitions of strength and skill in archery to demonstrate their fitness to rule. In such exhibitions, pharaohs such asAmenhotep II(ruled 1426\u20131400bce) never competed against anyone else, however, and there is reason to suspect that their extraordinary achievements were scribal fictions. Nonetheless, Egyptians with less claim to divinity wrestled, jumped, and engaged in ball games and stick fights. In paintings found at Beni Hassan, in a tomb dating from the Middle Kingdom (1938\u2013c. 1630bce), there are studies of 406 pairs of wrestlers demonstrating their skill.\nSince Minoan script still baffles scholars, it is uncertain whether images of Cretan boys and girls testing their acrobatic skills against bulls depict sport, religious ritual, or both. That the feats of the Cretans may have been both sport and ritual is suggested by evidence from Greece, where sports had a cultural significance unequaled anywhere else before the rise of modern sports.Secularand religious motives mingle in history\u2019s first extensive \u201csports report,\u201d found in Book XXIII of Homer\u2019sIliadin the form of funeral games for the dead Patroclus. These games were part ofGreek religionand were not, therefore, autotelic; the contests in theOdyssey, on the other hand, were essentially secular. Odysseus was challenged by the Phaeacians to demonstrate his prowess as an athlete. In general, Greek culture included both cultic sports, such as the Olympic Games honouringZeus, and secular contests.\nThe most famous association of sports and religion was certainly theOlympic Games, which Greek tradition dates from 776bce. In the course of time, the earth goddess Gaea, originally worshiped atOlympia, was supplanted in importance by the sky god Zeus, in whose honour priestly officials conducted quadrennial athletic contests. Sacred games also were held at Delphi (in honour of Apollo), Corinth, and Nemea. These four events were known as theperiodos, and great athletes, such as Theagenes of Thasos, prided themselves on victories at all four sites. Although most of the events contested at Greek sacred games remain familiar, the most important competition was the chariot race. The extraordinary prestige accorded athletic triumphs brought with it not only literaryaccolades(as in the odes ofPindar) and visual commemoration (in the form of statues of the victors) but also material benefits, contrary to the amateurmythpropagatedby 19th-century philhellenists. Since the Greeks were devoted to secular sports as well as to sacred games, no polis, or city-state, was considered a propercommunityif it lacked agymnasiumwhere, as the wordgymnosindicates, naked male athletes trained and competed. Except in militaristic Sparta, Greek women rarely participated in sports of any kind. They were excluded from the Olympic Games even as spectators (except for the priestess of Demeter). The 2nd-century-cetravelerPausaniaswrote of races for girls at Olympia, but these events in honour of Hera were of minor importance.\nAlthoughchariot raceswere among the most popular sports spectacles of the Roman andByzantineeras, as they had been in Greek times, the Romans of the republic and the early empire were quite selectively enthusiastic about Greek athletic contests. Emphasizing physical exercises for military preparedness, an important motive in all ancient civilizations, the Romans preferred boxing, wrestling, andhurlingthe javelin torunningfootraces and throwing the discus. The historian Livy wrote of Greek athletes\u2019 appearing in Rome as early as 186bce; however, the contestants\u2019 nudity shocked Roman moralists. The emperorAugustusinstituted theActian Games in 27bceto celebrate his victory over Antony and Cleopatra, and several of hissuccessorsbegan similar games, but it was not until the later empire, especially during the reign ofHadrian(117\u2013138ce), that many of the Roman elite developed an enthusiasm for Greek athletics.\nGreater numbers flocked to the chariot races held in Rome\u2019sCircus Maximus. They were watched by as many as 250,000 spectators, five times the number that crowded into theColosseumto enjoygladiatorialcombat. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that the latter contests were actually more popular than the former. Indeed, themunera, which pitted man against man, and thevenationes, which set men against animals, became popular even in the Greek-speaking Eastern Empire, which historians once thought immune from the lust for blood. The greater frequency of chariot races can be explained in part by the fact that they were relatively inexpensive compared with the enormous costs of gladiatorial combat. Theeditorwho staged the games usually rented the gladiators from alanista(the manager of a troupe of gladiators) and was required to reimburse him for losers executed in response to a \u201cthumbs down\u201d sign. Brutal as these combats were, many of the gladiators were free men who volunteered to fight, an obvious sign ofintrinsicmotivation. Indeed, imperial edicts were needed to discourage the aristocracy\u2019s participation. During the reign of Nero (54\u201368), female gladiators were introduced into thearena.\nThe Romancircusand the Byzantinehippodromecontinued to provide chariot racing long after Christian protests (and heavy economic costs) ended the gladiatorial games, probably early in the 5th century. In many ways the chariot races were quite modern. The charioteers were divided into bureaucratically organized factions (e.g., the \u201cBlues\u201d and the \u201cGreens\u201d), which excited the loyalties of fans fromBritainto Mesopotamia. Charioteers boasted of the number of their victories as modern athletes brag about their \u201cstats,\u201d indicating, perhaps, someincipientawareness of what in modern times are calledsports records. The gladiatorial games, however, like the Greek games before them, had a powerful religious dimension. The first Roman combats, in 264bce, were probably derived from Etruscan funeral games in which mortal combat provided companions for the deceased. It was the idolatry of the games, even more than their brutality, that horrified Christian protesters. The less-obtrusive pagan religious associations of the chariot races helped them survive for centuries after Constantine\u2019s conversion to Christianity in 337ce.\nThe sports ofmedievalEurope were less well-organized than those of classical antiquity. Fairs and seasonal festivals were occasions for men to lift stones or sacks of grain and for women to run smock races (for a smock, not in one). The favourite sport of the peasantry wasfolk football, a wild no-holds-barred unbounded game that pitted married men against bachelors or one village against another. The violence of the game, which survived in Britain and in France until the late 19th century, prompted Renaissance humanists, such asSir Thomas Elyot, to condemn it as more likely to maim than to benefit the participants.\nThenascentbourgeoisieof theMiddle Agesand the Renaissance amused itself witharcherymatches, some of which were arranged months in advance and staged with considerable fanfare. When town met town in a challenge of skill, the companies of crossbowmen and longbowmen marched behind the symbols ofSt. George,St. Sebastian, and other patrons of the sport. It was not unusual for contests in running, jumping, cudgeling, and wrestling to be offered for the lower classes who attended the match as spectators. Grand feasts were part of the program, and drunkenness commonly added to the revelry. In Germanic areas aPritschenkoenigwas supposed to simultaneously keep order and entertain the crowd with clever verses.\nThe burghers of medieval towns were welcome to watch thearistocracyat play, but they were not allowed to participate intournamentsor even, in most parts of Europe, to compete in imitative tournaments of their own. Tournaments were the jealously guardedprerogativeof the medievalknightand were, along with hunting andhawking, his favourite pastime. At thetilt, in which mounted knights with lances tried to unhorse one another, the knight was practicing the art of war, his raison d\u2019\u00eatre. He displayed his prowess before lords, ladies, and commoners and profited not only from valuable prizes but also from ransoms exacted from the losers. Between the 12th and the 16th century, the dangerously wild free-for-all of the earlytournamentevolved into dramatic presentations of courtly life in which elaborate pageantry and allegorical display quite overshadowed the frequently ineptjousting. Some danger remained even amid the display. At one of the last great tournaments, in 1559,Henry IIof France was mortallywoundedby a splintered lance.\nPeasant women participated freely in the ball games and footraces of medieval times, and aristocratic ladies hunted and kept falcons, but middle-class women contented themselves with spectatorship. Even so, they were more active than their contemporaries in Heian Japan during the 8th to 12th centuries. Encumbered by many-layered robes and sequestered in their homes, the Japanese ladies were unable to do more than peep from behind their screens at the courtiers\u2019 mounted archery contests.\nBy the time of theRenaissance, sports had become entirely secular, but in the minds of the 17th-century Czech educatorJohn Amos Comeniusand other humanists, a concern for physical education on what were thought to be classic models overshadowed the competitive aspects of sports. Indeed, 15th- and 16th-century elites preferred dances to sports and delighted in geometric patterns of movement. Influenced by the ballet, which developed in France during this period, choreographers trained horses to perform graceful movements rather than to win races. French and Italian fencers such as the famedGirard Thibault, whoseL\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de l\u2019esp\u00e9e(\u201cFencing Academy\u201d) appeared in 1628, thought of their activity more as an art form than as a combat. Northern Europeans emulated them. Humanistically inclined Englishmen and Germans admired thecultivatedFlorentine game ofcalcio, a form of football that stressed the good looks and elegant attire of the players. Within the world of sports, the emphasis onaesthetics, rather than achievement, was never stronger.\nWhile theaestheticelement survives in sports such asfigure skating,diving, andgymnastics, the modern emphasis is generally on quantified achievement. In fact, the transition from Renaissance to modern sports can be seen in a semantic shift; the wordmeasure, which once connoted a sense of balance and proportion, began to refer almost exclusively to numerical measurements.\nBehind this epochal transition from Renaissance to modern sports lay the scientific developments that sustained theIndustrial Revolution. Technicians sought to perfect equipment. Athletes trained systematically to achieve their physical maximum. New games, such as basketball,volleyball, andteam handball, were consciously invented to specifications as if they were new products for the market. As early as the late 17th century, quantification became an important aspect of sports, and the cultural basis was created for theconceptof the sports record. The wordrecord, in the sense of an unsurpassed quantified achievement, appeared, first in English and then in other languages, late in the 19th century, but the concept went back nearly 200 years.\nThe development of modern sports having begun in late 17th-century England, it was appropriate that the concept of the sports record also first appeared there. During the Restoration and throughout the 18th century, traditional pastimes such asstick fighting andbullbaiting, which the Puritans had condemned and driven underground, gave way to organized games such ascricket, which developed under the leadership of theMarylebone Cricket Club(founded 1787). Behind these changes lay a new conception of rationalized competition. Contests that seem odd to the modern mind, such as those in which the physically impaired were matched against children, were replaced byhorse racesin which fleeter steeds werehandicapped, a notion of equality that led eventually to age and weight classes (though not to height classes) in many modern sports. Although the traditional sport ofboxingflourished throughout the 18th century, it was not until 1743 that boxer-entrepreneurJack Broughtonformulated rules to rationalize and regulate the sport. The minimal controls onmayhemimposed by Broughton were strengthened in 1867 by themarquess of Queensberry.\nIn the course of the 19th century, modern forms of British sports spread from the privileged classes to the common people. National organizations developed to standardize rules and regulations, to transform sporadic challenge matches into systematic league competition, to certify eligibility, and to register results.\nRowing(crew), one of the first sports to assume its modern form, began to attract a following after the first boat race between the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge (1829) and the inauguration of theHenley Regatta(1839). \u201cAthletics\u201d became popular after Oxford and Cambridge held their first track-and-field meet in 1864. TheAmateur Athletic Association, which emphasized track-and-field sports, was founded in 1880, the Amateur Rowing Association in 1882.\nNeither sport enjoyed the popularity ofassociation football. The various versions of football played at elite schools such as Eton, Winchester, and Charterhouse were codified in the 1840s, and England\u2019s Football Association was formed in 1863 topropagatewhat came to be known as \u201cassociation football\u201d (or simply \u201csoccer\u201d). TheRugby Football Unionfollowed in 1871. Although theFootball Associationand most of itsaffiliatedclubs were initially dominated by the middle and upper classes, soccer had definitely become \u201cthe people\u2019s game\u201d by the end of the century. For instance,Manchester United, one of Britain\u2019s most storied teams, can trace its history to a club established by the city\u2019s railroad workers in 1880.\nThe entry of working-class athletes into soccer and other sports, as participants if not as administrators, inspired Britain\u2019s middle and upper classes to formulate the amateur rule, which originally excluded not only anyone paid for athletic performances but also anyone who earned his living by manual labour of any sort.\nFrom the British Isles, modern sports (and theamateurrule) were diffused throughout the world. Sports that originally began elsewhere, such as tennis (which comes from Renaissance France), were modernized and exported as if they too were raw materials imported for British industry to transform and then export as finished goods.\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the British expelled the French from Canada and from India and extended British rule over much of Africa. To the ends of the earth, cricket followed the Union Jack, which explains the game\u2019s current popularity in Australia, South Asia, and theWest Indies.Rugbyfootball flourishes in other postcolonial cultures, such asNew ZealandandSouth Africa, where the British once ruled. It was, however, association football\u2019s destiny to become the world\u2019s most widely played modern sport.\nCricket and rugby seemed to require British rule in order to take root. Football needed only the presence of British economic and cultural influence. In Buenos Aires, for instance, British residents founded clubs for cricket and a dozen other sports, but it was the Buenos Aires Football Club, founded June 20, 1867, that kindled Argentine passions. In almost every instance, the first to adopt football were thecosmopolitansons of local elites, many of whom had been sent to British schools by their Anglophile parents. Seeking status as well as diversion, middle-class employees of British firms followed the upper-class lead. From the gamut of games played by the upper and middle classes, the industrial workers of Europe and LatinAmerica, like theindigenouspopulation of Africa, appropriated football as their own.\nBy the late 19th century, the United States had begun to rival Great Britain as an industrial power and as an inventor of modern sports. Enthusiasts ofbaseballdenied its origins in British children\u2019s games such as cat androundersand concocted the myth ofAbner Doubleday, who allegedly invented the game in 1839 in Cooperstown,New York. A more plausible date for the transformation of cat and rounders into baseball is 1845, when a New York bank clerk named Alexander Cartwright formulated the rules of the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club. Even before the Civil War, the game had been taken over by urban workers such as the volunteer firemen who organized the New York Mutuals in 1857. By the time the National League was created in 1876, the game had spread from coast to coast. (It was not until the 1950s, however, thatMajor League Baseballplanted its first franchises on the West Coast.)\nBasketball, invented in 1891 byJames Naismith, and volleyball, invented four years later byWilliam Morgan, are both quintessentially modern sports. Both were scientifically designed to fulfill a perceived need for indoor games during harshNew Englandwinters.\nFootball (soccer) is the world\u2019s most popular ball game, but, wherever American economic and culture influence has been dominant, the attraction to baseball, basketball, and volleyball has tended to exceed that to football. Baseball, for example, boomed in Cuba, where Nemesio Guill\u00f3 introduced the game to his countrymen in 1863, and in Japan, where Horace Wilson, an American educator, taught it to his Japanese students in 1873. Since basketball and volleyball were both invented under theauspicesof theYMCA(Young Men\u2019s Christian Association), it seemed reasonable for YMCA workers to take the games to China, Japan, and the Philippines, where the games took root early in the 20th century. It was, however, only in the post-World War II world that U.S. influence generally overwhelmed British; only then did basketball and volleyball become globally popular.\nAmerican football, which now enjoys enclaves of enthusiasm in Great Britain and on the European continent, traces its origins to 1874, when a rugby team from Montreal\u2019sMcGill Universitytraveled to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to challenge a team ofHarvard Universitystudents. Adopted by American students, rugby evolved intogridiron football, and in that form it became the leading intercollegiate game. Although theNational Football Leaguewas established in 1920 (at $100 a franchise), the professional game was a relatively minor affair until afterWorld War II, when football joined baseball and basketball to form the \u201ctrinity\u201d of American sports. (Ice hockey, imported from Canada, runs a poor fourth in the race for fans of team sports.)\nIn the dramatic globaldiffusionof modern sports, the French have also played a significant role. They left it to an Englishman, Walter Wingfield, to modernize the game oftennis, which originated in Renaissance France, but the French took the lead, early in the 19th century, in the development of the bicycle and in the popularization ofcyclingraces. The first Paris\u2013Rouen race took place in 1869; theTour de Francewas inaugurated in 1903. The huge success of the latter inspired the Giro d\u2019Italia (1909) and a number of other long-distance races.\nThe French also left their mark on sports in another way. In 1894, at a conference held at the Sorbonne in Paris, Pierre de Coubertin selected the first members of a Comit\u00e9 International Olympique (International Olympic Committee; IOC) and arranged for the first Olympic Games of the modern era to be held in Athens in 1896. In 1904 Robert Gu\u00e9rin led a group of football (soccer) enthusiasts in forming theF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association(FIFA), which England\u2019s insular Football Association was at first tooarrogantto join. The English name of the International Amateur Athletic Federation (1912; since 2001 known as theInternational Association of Athletics Federations; IAAF) suggests that the British were more cooperative in track-and-field sports than in football, but the IAAF\u2019s founder was a Swedish industrialist, Sigfrid Edstr\u00f6m.\nJapan, one of the few non-Western nations where traditional sports still rival modern ones in popularity, is also one of the few non-Western nations to contribute significantly to the repertory of modern sports.Judo, invented in 1882 by Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d in an effort to combine Western and Asian traditions, attracted European adherents early in the 20th century. In 1964 judo became an Olympic sport.\nFrom 1952, when theSoviet Unionemerged from its self-imposed sports isolation, to 1991, when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republicsceasedto exist, thecommunistsocieties of eastern Europe dominated the Olympic Games. In 1988, for instance, theGerman Democratic Republic(East Germany), with a population of some 16 million, outscored the United States, 15 times its size. While anabolic steroids and other banned substances contributed to the East Germans\u2019 triumph, credit must also be given to their relentless application of scientific methods in the search for the ultimate sports performance. The collapse of communism undermined state-sponsored elite sports in eastern Europe, but not before the nations of western Europe had begun to emulate their athletic adversaries by sponsoring scientific research, subsidizing elite athletes, and constructingvasttraining centres.\nIn the 20th century, sports underwent social as well as spatial diffusion. After a long and frequently bitter struggle,African Americans, Australian Aboriginal people, \u201cCape Coloureds\u201d (in South Africa), and other excluded racial and ethnic groups won the right to participate in sports. After a long and somewhat less-bitter struggle, women also won the right to compete in sports\u2014such as rugby\u2014that had been considered quintessentially masculine.\nWhile theBritish Islesmay be considered the homeland of modern sports, modernphysical educationcan be traced back to German and Scandinavian developments of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Men such asJohann Christoph Friedrich Guts MuthsinGermanyandPer Henrik Lingin Sweden elaborated systems of gymnasticexercisethat were eventually adopted by school systems in Britain, the United States, and Japan. These noncompetitivealternativesto modern sports also flourished in eastern Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among repressed ethnic peoples such as the Poles and Czechs,gymnasticsbecame almost a way of life. For them, gymnastic festivals were grand occasions at which tens of thousands ofdisciplinedmen and women demonstrated nationalistic fervour.\nGymnastic fervour was not, however, much in evidence among the world\u2019s schoolchildren and college students as they encountered gymnastics in required physical-education classes. Calisthenic exercises designed to improve health and fitness were dull and dreary compared with the excitement of modern sports. Long before the end of the 20th century, even German educators had abandonedLeibeserziehung(\u201cphysical education\u201d) in favour ofSportunterricht(\u201cinstruction in sports\u201d). For young and for old, for better and for worse, sports are the world\u2019s passion.", "https://testbook.com/static-gk/introduction-to-indian-geography": "Introduction to indian geography\nIntroduction to Indian Geography\nIndian Geography- Territorial Limits\nIndian Geography - Physical Features\nIndian Geography- Cities of India\nIndian Geography- International Boundaries\nNickname Of Indian Cities\nAndhra Pradesh\nAssam\nArunachal Pradesh\nBihar\nChhattisgarh\nDelhi\nGujarat\nHaryana\nHimachal Pradesh\nJharkhand\nKarnataka\nKerala\nMadhya Pradesh\nMaharashtra\nManipur\nMeghalaya\nNagaland\nOdisha\nPuducherry\nPunjab\nRajasthan\nTamil Nadu\nTelangana\nUttarakhand\nUttar Pradesh\nWest Bengal\nIndian Geography - FAQs\nWhat is the length of the Indian mainland?\nWhat do the physical features of India include?\nWhich city is called the \u201cGateway of South India\u201d?\nHow long is India\u2019s land border?\nWhich cities are the metropolitan cities of India?\nIndia shares the largest land boundary with which country?\nWhat is the nickname of Itanagar (Arunachal Pradesh)?\nWhat is the area of india?\nFrom the Himalayas in the north to the beaches in the south, India has a diverse terrain.

Several islands in the Indian Ocean, like the Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep group of islands, are also part of India's territory. Some facts about India and its territorial limits have mentioned below:\nTRIVIA:During the Tsunami of 2004, the southernmost part of India, which was called \"Indira Point\" and was on the Great Nicobar Island of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, was flooded by the sea.\nIndian Geography- Time Zone\nOne of the lesser-known but significant aspects of Indian geography is its time zones. India observes a time difference of 30 minutes between its easternmost and westernmost points, which is unique in the world. This means that when it is noon in the west, it is already half-past noon in the east.\nIndia is a big country with a lot of different kinds of landscapes, such as the mountains, plateaus, plains, deserts, rivers, and a coast.

Python requests provide inbuilt functionalities for managing both the request and response.\nPython requests module has several built-in methods to make HTTP requests to specified URL using GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or HEAD requests. HTTP request is meant to either retrieve data from a specified URI or to push data to a server. It works as a request-response protocol between a client and a server.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will explore What isPython Request Library,  How to makeGET requeststhrough Python Requests, Response objects and Methods, Authentication using Python Requests, and so on.\nLet\u2019s demonstrate how to make a GET request to an endpoint. GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request. The page and the encoded information are separated by the \u2018?\u2019 character. For example:\nSyntax\nLet\u2019s try making a request to github\u2019s APIs for example purposes.\nsave this file as request.py and through terminal run,\nOutput \u2013\n\nFor more, visit  \u2013GET method \u2013 Python requests\n\n\nWhen one makes a request to a URL, it returns a response. This Response object in terms of python is returned by requests.method(), method being \u2013 get, post, put, etc. Response is a powerful object with lots of functions and attributes that assist in normalizing data or creating ideal portions of code.\nFor example,response.status_codereturns the status code from the headers itself, and one can check if the request was processed successfully or not. Response object can be used to imply lots of features, methods, and functionalities.\nExample :\n\nSave this file as request.py, and run using below command\n\n\n\nStatus code 200 indicates that request was made successfully.\n\n\nAuthentication refers to giving a user permissions to access a particular resource. Since, everyone can\u2019t be allowed to access data from every URL, one would require authentication primarily. To achieve this authentication, typically one provides authentication data through Authorization header or a custom header defined by server.\nExample \u2013\n\nReplace \u201cuser\u201d and \u201cpass\u201d with your username and password. It will authenticate the request and return a response 200 or else it will return error 403.\n\nFor more visit \u2013Authentication using Python requests\nRequests verifies SSL certificates for HTTPS requests, just like a web browser. SSL Certificates are small data files that digitally bind a cryptographic key to an organization\u2019s details. Often, an website with a SSL certificate is termed as secure website. By default, SSL verification is enabled, and Requests will throw a SSLError if it\u2019s unable to verify the certificate.\nLet us try to access a website with an invalid SSL certificate, using Python requests\n\nOutput :-\n\nThis website doesn\u2019t have SSL setup so it raises this error. one can also pass the link to the certificate for validation via python requests only.\n\nThis would work in case the path provided is correct for SSL certificate for github.com.\nFor more visit-SSL Certificate Verification \u2013 Python requests\nSession object allows one to persist certain parameters across requests. It also persists cookies across all requests made from the Session instance and will use urllib3\u2019s connection pooling. So if several requests are being made to the same host, the underlying TCP connection will be reused, which can result in a significant performance increase. A session object all the methods as of requests.\nLet us illustrate use of session objects by setting a cookie to a url and then making a request again to check if cookie is set.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor more, visit \u2013Session Objects \u2013 Python requests\n\nN\n"}
